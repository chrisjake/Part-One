#Tramadol

Tramadol is an analgesic agent with a complicated mechanism of action:
* Action at all opioid receptors, but particularly MOP, causing analgesia as well as nausea and vomiting
* Inhibits 5-HT reuptake which provides descending inhibitory analgesia 
* Inhibits NA reuptake descending inhibitory analgesia
* NMDA receptor antagonist
