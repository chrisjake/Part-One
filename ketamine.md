|--|--|
|**Class**|Phencyclidine derivative and NMDA receptor antagonist|
|**Uses**|Induction of anaesthesia, sedation, analgesia, asthma|
|**Presentation**| Clear, colourless solution|
|**Isomerism**| Racemic mixture or the single S(+) enantiomer, which is 2-3x as potent as the R(-) enantiomer|

|**Metabolism**| Hepatic metabolism to active norketamine by CYP450 and then to inactive metabolites|
|**Elimination**|Renal eliminiation of inactive metabolites|
|**Resp**|Bronchodilation, presevation of laryngeal reflexes|
|**CVS**|↑ Sympathetic outflow: ↑ HR, ↑ BP ↑ SVR ↑ MVO<sub>2</sub>. Acts directly as a myocardial depressant. Depresses baroreceptor reflex.|
|**CNS**|Dissociation, analgesia, emergence phenomena (hallucinations, delirium) reduced by concurrent BDZ administration (increasing risk with higher doses and rapid administration). ↑ CBF and ↑ CMRO<sub>2</sub>|
