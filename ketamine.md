# Ketamine

Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative used for induction, sedation, and analgesia. Ketamine may also be used as a bronchodilator in severe asthma.

|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Phencyclidine derivative and NMDA receptor antagonist|
|**Uses**|Induction of anaesthesia, sedation, analgesia, asthma|
|**Presentation**| Clear, colourless solution forming an acidic solution (pH 3.5-5.5)|
|**Isomerism**| Racemic mixture or the single S(+) enantiomer, which is 2-3x as potent as the R(-) enantiomer|
|**Route of Administration**|IV, IM|
|**Dosing**|Induction: 1-2mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IV, 5-10mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IM, Sedation: 0.2-0.5mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IV|
|**Distribution**|25% protein bound|
|**Metabolism**| Hepatic metabolism to active norketamine by CYP450 and then to inactive metabolites|
|**Elimination**|Renal eliminiation of inactive metabolites|
|**Mechanism of Action**|
|**Resp**|Bronchodilation, tachypnoea, relative presevation of laryngeal reflexes. Apnoea with rapid injection.|
|**CVS**|↑ Sympathetic outflow: ↑ HR, ↑ BP ↑ SVR ↑ MVO<sub>2</sub>. Acts directly as a myocardial depressant. Depresses baroreceptor reflex.|
|**CNS**|Dissociation, analgesia, emergence phenomena (hallucinations, delirium) reduced by concurrent BDZ administration (increasing risk with higher doses and rapid administration). ↑ CBF and ↑ CMRO<sub>2</sub>. Produces dissociative anaesthesia within 90 second by dissociating thalmaocortical and limbic systems on EEG.|
|**Renal**|Cystitis with long-term, high-dose use|
|**GIT**|N/V|
