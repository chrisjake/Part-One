##Modified Bohr Equation
The ratio of dead space to tidal volume ventilation equations the arterial - mixed-expired CO2 difference, over the arterial CO2.
$$ {V_D \over V_T} = {PaCO_2 - PE'CO_2 \over PaCO_2}$$

##Boyle's Law
PV = K, i.e. pressure and volume are inversely related at constant temperature and pressure

##Charle's Law
V = KT, i.e. volume and temperature are linearly related when pressure is constant.

##The Universal Gas Equation
PV = nRT, i.e. combination of Boyle's, Charle's law combining each variable and the universal gas constant, R (8.13)

##Henry's Law
The number of molecules of dissolved gas is equal to the partial pressure of the gas at the surface of the liquid

##Graham's Law of Diffusion
Diffusion rates through orifices are inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight

##La Place's Law
The larger the vessel radius, the larger the wall tension required to withstand a given internal fluid pressure. For a thin-walled sphere, Wall Tension (T) is half the product of pressure and radius, i.e. $$ T = {P.r \over 2}$$

##Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure
In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts the pressure that it would exert if it occupied the volume alone

##Fick's Law of Diffusion
Flow of a gas across a sheet is:

$$\dot{V}_{gas} = {A \times D \times \Delta P \over T} $$ , where:
* $$A$$ = Area of the sheet
* $$D$$ = Diffusion constant, which is proportional to the **solubility** of the gas and inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight, i.e. $$ D \propto {Sol \over \sqrt{MW}}$$
* $$T$$ = Thickness of the sheet

##Fick's Principle
Flow of blood through an organ equals the uptake of a tracer substance by the organ divided by the concentration difference of the substance across it, i.e.

$$ \dot{Q} = {\dot{V}_{O_2} \over Ca_{O_2} - C\bar{v}_{O_2}} $$

##Starling's Law of Fluid Exchange
Flow of fluid across the capillaries is proportional to the hydrostatic pressure difference and the oncotic pressure difference (times the reflection coefficient), all times by the filtraiton coefficient, i.e.:

$$ Net \ flow \ out = K[(P_c - P_i) - \sigma (\pi_c - \pi_i))] $$

##Alveolar Gas Equation
The alveolar PO2 is equal to the PiO2 minus the alveolar CO2/the respiratory quotient, i.e.:

$$ PA_{O_2} = Pi_{O_2} - {PA_{CO_2} \over R}$$

##Venous Admixture
$${\dot{Q}_S \over \dot{Q}_T} = {Cc'_{O_2} - Ca'_{O_2} \over Cc'_{O_2} - C\bar{v}'_{O_2}}$$

##Nernst Equation
The Nernst Equation calculates the electrochemical equilibrium for a given ion.

$$ E \ (mV) = {R.T \over z.F}ln{[ion]_{outside} \over [ion]_{inside}} $$, where:
* $$E$$ is the equilibrium potential for the ion
* $$R$$ is the gas constant (8.314 J.deg<sup>-1</sup>.mol<sup>-1</sup>)
* $$T$$ is the temperature in Kelvin
* $$F$$ is Faraday's Constant
* $$z$$ is the ionic valency (e.g. +2 for Mg<sup>+2</sup>, -1 for Cl<sup>-</sup>)

##Reynolds Number
Reynolds Number is a dimensionless index used to predict the liklihood of turbulent flow. R<2000 is likely to be laminar, R>2000 is likely to be turbulent.

$$ Reynolds \ Number = {2rvd \over n} $$

Where:

* v is the linear velocity of fluid in $$m/s$$
* d is the fluid density in $$Pa S$$
* r is the radius in $$m$$
* n is the viscosity in $$m^2 / s$$

###Hagan-Poiseuille Equation
Models laminar flow - where a fluid moves steadily wihtout turbulence. This ususally occurs in smooth tubes at low rates. Flow is fasted in the **centre**, where it is about **twice the mean flow**, and approaches zero at the walls. In laminar flow states, flow is directly proportional to the driving pressure.

* Incompressible fluid
* Laminar flow
* Cylindrical pipe of uniform cross-section

$$ Q = {\pi P r^4 \over 8 v l} $$

Where:

* Q is the flow
* P is the driving pressure
* v is the dynamic viscosity
* L is the length of tubing
* r is the radius

From this it can be seen that flow is proportional to the 4th power of the diameter, and indirectly proportional to diameter.
