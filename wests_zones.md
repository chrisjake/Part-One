# West's Zones {#id}
> Describe West's zones of the lung and explain the mechanisms responsible for them

**West's Zones** take into account the effect of alveolar pressure on pulmonary blood flow. The lung is divided into **four zones**:
* **West Zone 1: P<sub>A</sub> > P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>v</sub>**  
Alveolar pressure exceeds arterial pressure.
  * The alveolus compresses the capillary, and no blood flow occurs
  * As there is ventilation but no perfusion, this can also be thought of as **dead space**
  * This occurs when:
    * Alveolar pressure is high
      * PEEP
    * Arterial pressure is low
      * Shock
        * Hypovolaemia


* **West Zone 2: P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>A</sub> > P<sub>v</sub>**  
Arterial pressure exceeds alveolar pressure, which exceeds venous pressure.  
  * Blood flow occurs **intermittently** during the cardiac cycle
  * Alveolar pressure acts as a **Starling resistor**  
  Flow is proportional to the P<sub>a</sub> - P<sub>A</sub>  gradient.
    * When P<sub>a</sub> falls below P<sub>A</sub> (e.g. in diastole), then no blood flow will occur


* **West Zone 3: P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>v</sub> > P<sub>A</sub>**  
Arterial pressure exceeds venous pressure which exceeds alveolar pressure.
  * Blood flow occurs throughout the cardiac cycle  
  Flow is proportional to the a</sub> - P<sub>v</sub>  gradient.
  * For an accurate measure of PCWP, a PAC must be placed in West Zone 3 (so there is a continual column of blood)
  * This tends to happen naturally as the majority of pulmonary flow is to this region


* **West Zone 4: P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>i</sub> > P<sub>v</sub> > P<sub>A</sub>**  
Interstitial pressure acts as a Starling resistor for pulmonary blood flow.
  * It is seen when interstitial pressure is high (e.g due to pulmonary oedema).
