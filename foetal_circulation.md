# Foetal Circulation

> Explain the physiological changes during pregnancy, and parturition

##In Utero
###Structure
The foetal circulation has a number of structural differences:
* Two **umbilical arteries**  
The umbilical artery returns deoxygenated blood to the placenta.
  * PaO<sub>2</sub> of 18mmhg (SpO<sub>2</sub> 45%)
* One **umbilical vein**  
The umbilical vein supplies oxygenated blood to the foetus. It:
  * Has a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 28mmHg (SpO<sub>2</sub> 70%)
  * 60% of blood from the umbilical vein enters the IVC
  * 40% of blood enters the liver
* Two ducts:
  * **Ductus venosus**  
  Shunts blood from the umbilical vein to the IVC.
  * **Ductus arteriosus**  
  Shunts blood from the pulmonary trunk to the descending aorta.
* A **foramen ovale**  
Shunts blood from the right atrium to the left atrium.
* **Immature myocardium**  
Foetal myocardium does not obey Starlings Law, and does not adjust contractility for any given preload. SV is fixed, and CO is HR dependent. Normal HR at term is 110-160 bpm.

###Circulation
* Oxygenated blood returns via the umbilical vein
  * 40% flows to the liver
  * 60% is returned to the IVC
* Oxygenated blood in the IVC is directed via the Eustachian valve through the foramen ovale
* Blood returning from the SVC is directed into the RV, and then into the descending aorta by the ductus arteriosus
  * ~10% of RV output flows through the pulmonary circulation
  
 This arrangement has several features:
 * Blood with the most oxygen being delivered to the arch vessels to supply the brain
 * Blood with the least oxygen being delivered to the umbilical arteries for gas exchange
 * Both the RV and the LV eject into systemic circulations, and are of similar size and wall thickness

##Changes at Birth
Several changes happen at birth:
* Placental circulation is lost  
There is a transition from circuits in parallel to circuits in series.
* An **FRC is established**  
Reversal of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in a rapid drop in PVR.
* The cord is clamped  
The systemic vascular bed volume falls, and SVR increases.

* The fall in PVR lowers RV afterload  
RAP falls
* The rise in SVR increases LV afterload  
LAP rises
* When LAP exceeds RAP, the foramen ovale closes

* Increased left sided afterload causes **flow reversal** in the ductus arteriosus  
There is progressive closure of the ductus over days, under the influence of prostaglandins.
