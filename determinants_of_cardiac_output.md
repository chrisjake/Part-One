# Determinants of Cardiac Output {#id}
> Define the components and determinants of cardiac output

Cardiac output a function of Heart Rate (HR) and Stroke Volume (SV):  
$$CO = HR \times SV $$.

* **Heart rate** is fairly intuitive
* **Stroke volume** is defined as the difference between ESV and EDV, i.e. $$ SV = EDV - ESV$$  
Stroke volume is a function of three factors:  
  * **Preload**
  * **Afterload**
  * **Contractility**


* Preload and afterload have [almost as many definitions as there are textbooks](http://advan.physiology.org/highwire/markup/5806/expansion?width=1000&height=500&iframe=true&postprocessors=highwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media)
* For the purpose of the exam, it's good to have both a laboratory and a clinical definition
* These definitions are those which have appeared in old examiner reports, or given to me by cardiac anaesthetists

##Preload

* **Preload** is defined as the **myocardial sarcomere length just prior to contraction**
* This is not measurable without removing the heart and cutting it into tiny pieces, so clinically it is usually **approximated by EDV** or, less appropriately, by EDP
  * EDV is typically calculated on echocardiography
  * EDP is typically measured using a CVC or PAC
    * CVP ≈ RVEDP
    * PCWP ≈ LVEDP


###Determinants of Preload
Preload is a function of:
* **Venous Return**
  * Intrathoracic Pressure
  * MSFP
    * Venous compliance 
    A decrease in venous compliance will increase LVEDP
    * Volume state
* **Ventricular compliance**  
Reduced in diastolic dysfunction.
* **Pericardial compliance**
* **Valvular disease**  
  * AV valve disease will impair preload
  * Semilunar valve disease will increase preload
* **Atrial kick**
* **Wall thickness**  
Increased ventricular wall thickness decreases preload
    * HOCM/Hypertrophy  


###Preload and the Respiratory Cycle
* Negative pressure causes RAP and PCWP to fall
* This increases RA filling and RVEDP and RVEDV increase relative to the pleural pressure (though absolute pressure is still low)
* LV effects are more variable
  * Negative intrapleural pressures:
    * Decrease LV transmural pressure (impairing ejection)
    * Cause bowing of the interventricular septum into the LV (reducing LVEDV)


###Frank-Starling Mechanism
* The **Frank-Starling Law of the Heart** states that the **strength of cardiac contraction is dependent on initial fibre length**
* At a cellular level, additional stretch increases:
  * The number of myofilament crossbridges that can interact
  * Myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity

* It is represented by the **ventricular function curve**
  * Plots preload against stroke volume (or cardiac output, assuming a constant heart rate)
  * Right shift of the curve demonstrates negative inotropy
  * Left shift of the curve demonstrates positive inotropy

##Afterload
* **Afterload** is  **the sum of forces, both elastic and kinetic, opposing ventricular ejection**
  * This definition is a bit wordy but avoids using the words "resistance" and "impedance", which are strictly defined in physics (and crudely applied in medicine), and may be jumped on by a cruel examiner

###Determinants of Afterload
Afterload is a function of:
* **Ventricular transmural systolic pressure**  
Transmural pressure is the difference between intrathoracic pressure and the pressure required for ventricular ejection.
    * Intrathoracic Pressure  
    Negative intrathoracic pressure will increase afterload, as the ventricle has to generate a greater change in pressure to achieve ejection.
      * PEEP reduces LV afterload
      * Negative-pressure ventilation with a high work of breathing increases afterload  
      This is why APO deteriorates - increased work of breathing increases LV afterload and worsens LV failure, increased pulmonary oedema, causing increased work of breathing... <br><br>
    * Pressure required for ventricular ejection  
    Must overcome:
      * Outflow tract impedance
        * Valvular disease
        * HOCM <br> <br>
      * Systemic arterial impedance (determined by **resistance**, **inertia**, and **compliance**)
          * Determinants of **resistance** are stated in the Poiseuille Equation:  
              $$ R = {8.η.l \over \pi.r^4}$$, where:
              * η = **Viscosity**  
              Affected by **haematocrit** (e.g. increased in polycythaemia) 
              * l = Vessel length  
              Fixed
              * r = Vessel **radius**  
                * Greatest determinant
                * Function of **degree of vasoconstriction** of resistance vessels <br><br>
          * **Inertia** is given by the mass of blood in the column, and is affected by **heart rate** <br><br>
          * Arterial **compliance**  
          Decreased arterial compliance increases afterload.
            * During ejection, the aorta and large arteries distend, reducing peak systolic pressure (impedance to further ejection)
              * Decreased arterial compliance increases the change in pressure for any given volume, increasing afterload during ejection
              * Decreased arterial compliance increases the speed of propagation of **reflected pressures waves** returning to the aortic root
                * Wave arrival in diastole augments coronary blood flow
                * Wave arrival during systole further increases afterload
            * In diastole the arteries recoil and blood pressure and flow are maintained - the **Windkessel effec**t.


    
* Ventricular systolic radius
    * End-Diastolic Volume  
     Increased EDV increases ventricular radius and therefore wall tension.
     

* Myocardial wall thickness  
  Ventricular hypertrophy *decreases* afterload by sharing wall tension (the product of pressure and radius) between a large number of sarcomeres.


##Contractility
* **Contractility **describes the** factors other than heart rate, preload, and afterload that are responsible for for changes in myocardial performance**.

###Determinants of Contractility
Contractility is primarily dependent on **intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>**.  Determinants include:
* Drugs
* Disease
  * Ischaemia  
  Reduced ATP production secondary to hypoxia, which impairs sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> function. Further exacerbated by intracellular acidosis from anaerobic metabolism.
  * Heart Failure  
  Impaired **contractility reserve**, i.e. minimal increase in contractility with sympathetic stimulation.
    * Reduced peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
* Autonomic Tone
* Bowditch Effect  
Contractility improves at faster heart rates. This is because the myocardium does not have time to remove calcium, so it accumulates intracellularly.
* Anrep Effect  
Contractility increases as afterload increases.

###Measuring Contractility
 * As with the other determinants of cardiac output, there has been some difficulty in developing measurable indicies for contractility
 * All measures of contractility are affected by preload or afterload to some extent


* **dP/dt<sub>max</sub>** ($$\Delta P \over \Delta T$$)  
 The **rate of rise** of LVP, assuming a constant preload and afterload
   * This index is **preload dependent** but **afterload independent**
   * Typically, the dP/dt<sub>max</sub> in isovolumetric ventricular contraction is used
   * A greater rate of rise indicates a more forceful contraction
   * Measurement requires LV catheterisastion


* **End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship**
  * Uses the ventricular Pressure-Volume Relationship
  * Line plotted at the tangent to the curve from the **end-systolic point** (when isovolumetric ventricular relaxation begins)
    * The steeper the gradient the greater the contractility


* **Ejection Fraction**  
Most common method used clinically is **ejection fraction**:  
$$EF \ (\%) = {SV \over EDV } \times 100 = {EDV - ESV \over EDV} \times 100 $$

* The use of wall stress for preload and afterload comes from the Cardiovascular Haemodynamics text, but is not used in the CICM texts

* [This](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ptens.html) site has a nice overview of wall tension, and the relationship of pressure to radius

* [This article](http://advan.physiology.org/content/25/1/53.long#T1) discusses the wall stress definition for preload and afterload

* Changes with ventilation are described with pretty graphs [here](http://www.derangedphysiology.com/main/core-topics-intensive-care/mechanical-ventilation-0/Chapter%202.1.8/haemodynamic-changes-during-mechanical-breath)
