#Adrenergic Vasoactives {#id}

*This covers the pharmacology of specific catecholamines and sympathomimetics. The synthesis of endogenous catecholamines is covered under [adrenal hormones](adrenal-hormones.md), whilst specific to catecholamines receptor function is covered under [adrenoreceptors](adrenoreceptors.md).*



Adrenergic drugs:
* Act via:
 * Dopamine (D)
 * Adrenoreceptors (α and β)
* Can be:
 * **Direct-acting**  
 Stimulate the receptor.
 * **Indirect-acting**  
 Stimulate the release of noradrenaline to cause effects.
* Classified as either:
 * **Naturally-occurring catecholamines**
 * **Synthetic catecholamines**
 * **Synthetic sympathomimetics**  
 Drugs which act on adrenoreceptors but are not classified as catecholamines due to their chemical structure.

##Structure-Activity Relationships of Catecholamines
Catecholamines consist of:
* A catechol ring  
A benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups in the 3 and 4 position.
  * Losing one hydroxyl group
    * Increases lipid solubility and decreases the potency 10-fold
    * Prevents metabolism by COMT, prolonging duration of action
  * Losing both hydroxyl groups decreases the potency 100-fold
	* Changing the hydroxyl groups to the 3 and 5 position increases beta-2 selectivity when there is also a large substitution present on the amine group
* An ethylamine tail  
Consists of:
 * Beta carbon
  * Adding a hydroxyl group decreases lipid solubility and CNS penetration
  * Adding any group increases alpha and beta effects
 * Alpha carbon
  * Adding a group prevents metabolism by MAO, prolonging duration of action
  * Methylation increases indirect activity
 * Amine group
  * Addition of a methyl group generally increases beta selectivity  
  As the chain length increases, so does the beta selectivity.
