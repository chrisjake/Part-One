#Position and ventilation

> Explain the effect of changes in posture on ventilatory function

Altered patient position can cause significant changes to V/Q matching.

##Lateral Decubitus
In the lateral position in a **spontaneously ventilating** patient:
* Dependent lung ventilation improves by ~10%  
Due to impaired compliance of the non-dependent lung (it hyperinflates) and improved compliance of the dependent lung (it is less expanded).
    * Dependent lung corresponds more to West Zone 3
    * Non-dependent lung corresponds more to West Zone 2
* Dependent lung perfusion improves by ~10%  
Due to the effect of gravity.

In the lateral position in a **positive-pressure ventilated** patient:
* The majority (~55%) of the tidal volume is delivered to the non-dependent lung
* The majority of pulmonary blood flow is delivered to the dependent lung
* The compliance of the dependent lung falls due to compression from the:
    * Mediastinum
    * Abdominal organs  
    These move cephalad in a paralysed patient.
* The dependent lung typically receives greater blood flow due to the effect of gravity
    * This may worsen V/Q matching
    * Blood flow is also affected by:
        * HPV  
        * Anatomical factors  
        Blood flow is greater in central than peripheral portions. 
        * Lung volume  
        Alterations is extra-alveolar and intra-alveolar pressures at FRC may alter regional blood flow.
* When both lungs are being ventilated, V/Q matching can be improved with selective application of PEEP to the dependent lung, which improves compliance

##Thoracotomy
Opening of a non-dependent hemithorax causes:
* Increased compliance and FRC of the non-dependent lung
* Reduced compliance and FRC of the dependent lung
