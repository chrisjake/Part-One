#Position and ventilation

> Explain the effect of changes in posture on ventilatory function

Altered patient position can cause significant changes to V/Q matching.

##Lateral Decubitus
In the lateral position in a **spontaneously ventilating** patient:


In the lateral position in a **positive-pressure ventilated** patient:
* The majority (~55%) of the tidal volume is delivered to the non-dependent lung
* The dependent lung compliance falls due to compression via the:
    * Mediastinum
    * Abdominal organs  
    These move cephalad in a paralysed patient.
* The dependent lung typically receives greater blood flow due to the effect of gravity
    * This may worsen V/Q matching
    * Blood flow is also affected by HPV  
        * HPV 
    

##Thoracotomy
Opening of a non-dependent hemithorax causes:
* Increased compliance and FRC of the non-dependent lung
* Reduced compliance and FRC of the dependent lung
