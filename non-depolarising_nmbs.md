# Non-Depolarising Neuromuscular Blockers

Non-depolarising NMBs are muscle relaxants used to:
*  Facilitate laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation
*  Control ICP
*  Improve respiratory system compliance
*  Improve patient safety on transportation

Mechanism of action is by competitive antagonism of ACh at the NMJ, preventing end-plate potentials from being generated. Effective pharmacodynamic response requires >70% receptor occupation.

##Common Features of Neuromuscular Blockers
|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Route of Administration**| IV/IM|
|**Distribution**|Small V<sub>D</sub> as they are polar and unable to cross lipid membranes|
|**Resp**|Apnoea|
|**MSK**|↑ Duration in hypothermia|
|**Renal**|↑ Duration in acidosis, ↑ duration in hypokalaemia, ↓ duration in hyperkalaemia, ↑ duration in hypermagnesaemia|
|**Metabolic**|Critical Illness Myopathy in patients with long-term relaxant use|
