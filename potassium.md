# Potassium
> Describe the function, distribution, regulation and physiological importance of ~~sodium, chloride,~~ potassium, ~~magnesium, calcium and phosphate~~ ions.

Potassium is the major intracellular cation, with 90% of total body potassium present in the ICF. A further 8% is sequestered in bone, with 2% present in the ECF.

Normal ECF concentration is 3.5-5mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>. Normal ICF concentration is ~150mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>.

##Function and Dysfunction
Potassium is important for:
* Regulation of intracellular pH
* Control of intracellular volume
* DNA and protien synthesis
* Enzymatic function
* Resting membrane potential

The **resting membrane potential** is determined by the ratio of intracellular:extracellular potassium, as per the Nernst equation. Small changes in extracellular ion concentration produce large changes in voltage, with significant effect on excitable tissues.

Rapid changes in potassium concentration cause symptoms at lower levels than chronic changes. Symptoms are related to the change in generation of action potentials
 
###Hyperkalaemia
Hyperkalaemia results in a less negative resting membrane potential, as per the Nernst equation). This brings the resting membrane potential closer to the threshold potential, causing 'instability' of excitable cell membranes as the cell cell is more likely to depolarise and increasing the liklihood of a spontaneous action potential. Action potentials exhibit a prolonged depolarisation phase, Symptoms of hyperkalaemia include weakness, paralysis, and parasthesias. ECG findings are those of **prolonged depolarisation** and **rapid repolarisation**.

###Hypokalaemia
Hypokalaemia results in a more-negative resting membrane potential. This makes it more difficult for a stimulus to reach the threshold potential, and therefore it is harder to generate and propagate action potential. ECG findings are those of **rapid depolarisation** and **prolonged repolarisation**, and include prolonged PR, long QT, flat T waves or TWI, U waves, and ST depression. Severe hypokalaemia may result in frequent supraventricular and ventricular ectopics, supraventricular arrythmias, and severe arrythmias.


##Regulation
Serum potassium is dependent on intake, sequestration, and elimination.

###Intake
Dietary intake may be highly variable. Potassium is completely absorbed from the upper GI tract.

###Sequestration
**Insulin** and **Î²<sub>2</sub>-agonism** results in increase activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump, shifting potassium into cells following a meal and during exercise.

**Acidosis** causes an **extracellular** shift of potassium, as hydrogen ions are exchanged for potassium ions. The reverse occurs in alkalosis.

Conversely, **cell lysis** may release a large amount of potassium into circulation and cause significant hyperkalaemia if a large number of cells are destroyed.

**Aldosterone** increases uptake of potassium into cells.

###Elimination
Elimination of potassium occurs via the kidneys, and is dependent on production of large volumes of glomerular filtrate and secretion by the **distal convoluted tubule** and **collecting duct**.

In normal conditions:
* The PCT and ascending limb reabsorb the majority of absorbed potassium  
This is essentially fixed.
 * PCT absorbs ~55%
 * Ascending limb absorbs ~30%
* The principal cells of the DCT and collecting duct secrete potassium  
Altering potassium secretion is the main method by which the kidney regulates serum potassium.
 * The collecting duct has a much greater role than the DCT
 * With normal dietary intake, more potassium is secreted than reabsorbed  
 This changes in conditions of potassium depletion.

####Control of Tubular Secretion
Tubular potassium secretion is controlled by **plasma [K<sup>+</sup>]** and **aldosterone**. An increased [K<sup>+</sup>] in plasma stimulates the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump in the principal cells, and also stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone increases production of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump, which also increases potassium secretion and uptake into cells.

Potassium secretion is affected by tubular flow rate, as the movement of potassium out of principal cells occurs down a passive concentration gradient.


####Effect of Sodium and Water
Sodium and water do not directly affect the elimination of potassium. High sodium content inhibits aldosterone release which reduces potassium elimination. Similarly, high water content inhibits ADH excretion and reduces secretion of potassium. However, high Na and H<sub>2</sub>O content also increases flow through the renal tubule, which indirectly increases tubular secretion of potassium.


####Effect of Alkalosis
Alkalosis results in an increased elimination of potassium as the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump is stimulated by low H<sup>+</sup> ion concentration.
