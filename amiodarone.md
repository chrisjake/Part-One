# Amiodarone

Amiodarone is an antiarrythmic agent with a complex mechanism of action and many effects.
* K<sup>+</sup> channel blockade in cardiac myocytes, inhibiting the slow outward current and slowing repolarisation (Class III)
* β-blocker-like activity on SA and AV nodes, decreasing automaticity and slowing nodal conduction (Class II)
* Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker-like activity on L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, decreasing the slow inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, increasing depolarisation time and decreasing nodal conduction (Class IV)
* α-blocker-like activity, decreasing SVR

|Property|Amiodarone|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Class III antiarrhythmic, though exhibits action from all 4 classes|
|**Uses**|VT/VF, resistant arrhythmia, ALS|
|**Presentation**|100/200mg tablets, IV: 150mg ampoule to be reconstituted in D5W|
|**Route of Administration**|IV/PO|
|**Dosing**|IV: Load with 5mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> over 1/24, with a further 15mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> over the following 24/24  PO: 200mg TDS for 1/52, 200mg BD for 1/52, 200mg OD thereafter|
|**Absorption**|Poor PO absorption with bioavailability ~50%|
|**Distribution**|Highly protein bound with very high V<sub>D</sub> of ~70L.kg<sup>-1</sup>s due to accumulation in fat and muscle|
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic metabolism with inhibition of CYP3A4 |
|**Elimination**|Very long t<sub>1/2</sub> of ~55 days. Biliary, skin, and lacrimal elimination|
|**Resp**|10% 3-year risk of pneumonitis, fibrosis, pleuritis|
|**CVS**|↓HR, ↓BP, ↓SVR, ↑QT without risk of TDP. Irritant to peripheral veins.|
|**CNS**|Mild blurring of vision from corneal deposition, sleep disturbance, vivid dreams, peripheral neuropathy|
|**MSK**|Photosensitivity, grey skin|
|**GIT**|Cirrhosis, hepatitis, and jaundice|
|**Metabolic**|Hyperthyroidism (1%) and hypothyroidism (6%)|
|**Other**|Amiodarone has potential to cause a number of drug interactions due to its inhibition of CYP3A4 and its high protein binding. A selection include: Digoxin, statins, warfarin, phenytoin, and other antiarrhythmics.

A **mnemonic** for some of the rarer effects is **BITCH**:
* **B**lue skin
* **I**nterstitial lung disease
* **T**hyroid
* **C**orneal
* **H**epatic
