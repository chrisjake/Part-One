# Hypothalamus and Pituitary

> Describe the control, secretions and functions of the pituitary and the hypothalamus

##Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is a circumventricular organ that regulates a large number of autonomic processes:
* **Thermoregulatory**  
Integrates thermoreceptor input and controls activity of heat loss and heat gain mechanisms.
* **Satiety**  
Feelings of hunger are modulated by glucose, CCK, glucagon, and leptin.
* **Water balance**  
    * Contains osmoreceptors which control ADH release from the posterior pituitary
    * Angiotensin II stimulates thirst and ADH release via the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum
* **Circadian rhythms**  
Balance between anterior and posterior hypothalamic stimulation controls sleep-wake cycle.
* **Pituitary control** 
    * Anterior pituitary by hormone secretion into the long portal vein. Secreted hormones include:
        * GnRH, stimulates FSH and LH release
        * CRH, stimulates ACTH release
        * GHRH, stimulates GH release
        * TRH, stimulates TSH release
        * Somatostatin, inhibits GH and TSH release
        * Dopamine, inhibits prolactin release
    * Posterior pituitary by neuronal innervation
* **Behaviour**  
Punishment and reward centres.
* **Sexual function**

##Pituitary
The **hypothalamic-pituitary axis** describes the complex feedback loops between these endocrine organs:
* **Short-loop feedback** describes negative feedback from the pituitary on the hypothalamus, e.g. thyroxine inhibiting TSH release.
* **Long-loop feedback** describes negative feedback from a pituitary target gland (i.e. thyroid, adrenal, gonads) on the hypothalamus, e.g. cortisol inhibiting CRH (as well as ACTH) release.
    * These axes are also named with target gland, e.g. hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

###Pituitary Hormones
The pituitary gland secretes **eight hormones** from **two lobes**:
* **Anterior Pituitary**  
Secretes **six** hormones in response to hypothalamic endocrine stimulus. These are classified as:
    * **Stimulating** hormones, which act at another gland:
        * **ACTH**  
        Short-chain peptide that stimulates cortisol release from the zona fasciculata. Release is stimulated by CRH, and inhibited by cortisol.
        * **TSH**  
        Glycoprotein that stimulates synthesis and release of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>. Release is stimulated by TRH, and inhibited by T<sub>3</sub>.
        * **FSH**  
        Glycoprotein gonadotropin. Release is stimulated by GnRH, and inhibted by circulating sex steroids. Has different effects depending on sex:
            * Females: Stimulates oestrogen synthesis and ovarian follicle development.
            * Males: Stimulates sperm maturation.
        * **LH**  
        Glycoprotein gonadotropin with different effects depending on sex:  
            * Females: Rapid increase stimulates ovulation and corpus luteum development.
            * Males: Stimulates testosterone synthesis.
    * **Direct acting** hormones:
        * **GH**  
        Long-chain peptide released in a pulsatile fashion. Release is stimulated by GHRH and is typically high with exercise, hypoglycaemia, and stress. Release is inhibited by somatostatin and IGF-1. GH has generally anabolic effects:
            * Directly stimulates lipolysis, increasing circulating FFA
            * Indirectly stimulates IGF-1 release, promoting cell growth and development
        * **Prolactin**  
        Long-chain peptide which promotes breast development during gestation, and lactation after delivery.


* **Posterior pituitary**  
Secretes **two** hormones, in response to hypothalamic neural stimulus:
    * **ADH**  
    Short-chain peptide which acts on:
        * V<sub>1</sub> receptors in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction
        * V<sub>2</sub> receptors in kidney collecting ducts to increase water reabsorption, and on endothelium to increase vWF and factor VIII release
        * V<sub>3</sub> receptors in the pituitary to stimulate ACTH release
    * **Oxytocin**  
    Short-chain peptide, structually similar to ADH, which causes:
        * Uterine contraction
        * Let-down reflex  
        Stimulates milk release on suckling.
        * Psychological  
        Pair bonding.
