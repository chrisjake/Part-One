# Coagulopathy Testing
> Outline the methods for assessing coagulation, platelet function and fibrinolysis

##Coagulation Factors
All these tests measure how long it takes to make fibrin. They evaluate different parts of the coagulation cascade, which help localise where a coagulopathy may be occurring.

In these tests:
* Citrate is added to blood  
Binds calcium and prevents clotting.
* Sample is centrifuged
* Plasma decanted
* Calcium (to replace the calcium lost by binding to citrate) and a reagent is added
* Time taken to clot measured

###Prothrombin Time (and INR)
The prothrombin time measures the **extrinsic pathway**. Tissue factor has to be added to the sample in order start clotting - this is why it is known as the extrinsic pathway as a substance extrinsic to the sample must be added. There is a lot of variability between different labs on PT, so the INR is used to compare values from different labs.

Any disorder of the extrinsic or common pathways will prolong the PT, i.e. deficiency or inhibition of:
* Factor VII
* Factor X
* Factor II (prothrombin)
* Factor V
* Factor I (fibrinogen)

The reason why warfarin is measured using INR (even though it affects factors in all three pathways) is that factor VII has the shortest half-life and so its levels fall most quickly, meaning measuring factor VII levels gives the earliest indication of changes in coagulation status. As factor VII is only in the extrinsic pathway, the PT/INR are the only tests which can evaluate its function.

###(Activated) Partial Thromboplastin Time
The partial thromboplastin time measures the **intrinsic pathway**, which begins produce fibrin when activated by the addition of phospholipid to the sample (phospholipid is contained in platelets, and so is not technically "extrinsic"). The activated partial thromboplastin time is the same test, except an activating agent is added to speed up the reaction.

Any disorder of the intrinsic or common pathways will prolong the APTT, i.e. deficiency or inhibition of:
* Factor XI
* Factor IX
* Factor VIII
* Factor X
* Factor V
* Factor II (prothrombin)
* Factor I (fibrinogen)

Heparin affects both sides of the pathway (IIa, IXa, Xa, XIa) however typically affects intrinsic factors more than extrinsic.

In addition, **anti-phospholipid antibodies** will also prolong the APTT by binding the added phospholipid.

###Activated Clotting Time
Activated Clotting Time is used to for the dosing and reversal of heparin in cardiopulmonary bypass and other extracorporeal circuits.

Fresh whole blood is added to a tube with an activator (e.g. glass beads) to stimulate the intrinsic pathway. The time until clot formation is measured in seconds. Different activators will have different normal ranges, and target ranges for the circuit in use.

##Platelet Function
Evaluate how well platelets aggregate in response to factors like ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid, and adrenaline (i.e., endogenous stimulators of platelet aggregation).

In this test, the aggregating agent is added to a tube of platelets, and the change in turbidity measured. Different patterns of response (or non-response) can be diagnostic of different platelet function disorders.
