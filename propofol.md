# Propofol {#id}

Propofol is a phenolic derivative which agonises GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors modulating its inhibitory action.

|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Phenolic derivative|
|**Uses**|Induction of anaesthesia, sedation, TIVA|
|**Presentation**| White oil-in-water emulsion containing 10mg.ml<sup>-1</sup> propofol, soybean oil, egg lecithin. Risk of bacterial contamination limits shelf life. Energy content is 1.1kcal.ml<sup>-1</sup>|
|**pKa**| 11 - almost all is unionised (and active) at physiologic pH|
|**Route of Administration**|IV only|
|**Dosing**|Induction: 1-2.5mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> Maintenance: 4-12mg/kg/hr|
|**Distribution**|98% protein bound. Very high V<sub>D</sub> at 4L.kg<sup>-1</sup>. Rapid re-distribution to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> compartments. Context sensitive half-time peaks at 50 minutes following a 9 hour infusion. t<sub>1/2<sub>ke0</sub> of **2.7** min.|
|**Metabolism**| Hepatic and extra-hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites. Unaffected by renal and hepatic disease.|
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of inactive metabolites. Reduced clearance in renal failure.|
|**Resp**|Respiratory depression, apnoea
|**CVS**|↓ SVR, ↓ BP, ↓ contractility, ↓ MVO<sub>2</sub>. Depresses baroreceptor reflex.|
|**CNS**|Obtundation, anticonvulsant, paradoxical excitatory effects (~10%)|
|**MSK**|Pain on injection into small veins|
|**Renal**|Green urine|
|**GIT**|Anti-emetic|
|**Metabolic**|Fat overload, lipaemia following prolonged infusion|
|**Toxic Effects**|Propofol infusion syndrome: Acidosis, bradycardia, and MODS following prolonged infusion (>24 hours), particularly with high doses (>4mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.hr<sup>-1</sup>), and in children.|
