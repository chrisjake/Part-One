> Describe the physiology of cerebrospinal fluid

CSF is a **transcellular** fluid in the ventricles and subarachnoid space. ~150ml (2ml/kg) of CSF exist in a normal individual, divided evenly between the head and spinal column.

##Functions
* **Mechanical Protection**  
  Due to its low specific gravity, CSF reduces the effective weight of the brain (by a factor of 30) and therefore reduces trauma caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the brain.
* **Stable Extracellular Environment**  
  Neurons are sensitive to ionic changes in the extracellular environment. Ionic concentrations in CSF are tightly controlled, which ensures stable neuronal activity. Toxins are actively removed from CSF.
* **pH Regulation**  
  pH of extracellular fluid is important in the control of respiration, and is also tightly regulated.
* **Nutrition**  
  Supply of O<sub>2</sub> and simple sugars and amino acids, and removal of CO<sub>2</sub> occurs occurs in CSF.

##Formation
CSF is produced in the **choroid plexus** (70%) and brain **capillary endotheilial cells** (30%) at a rate of 0.4 ml.min<sup>-1</sup> (**500ml.day<sup>-1</sup>**). It is produced by a combination of  **ultrafiltration** and **secretion** from plasma.

Na<sup>+</sup> is actively transported, resulting in flow of Cl<sup>-</sup> ions and water. Glucose transport is via facilitated diffusion down its concentration gradient.

###Factors Affecting Formation
Formation is relatively constant within normal parameters (altering the rate of absorption is the predominant means to control pressure), though it is reduced by:
* **Decreased Choroidal Blood Flow**  
  CPP <70mmHg reduces CSF formation.

###Contents
|Content|Relative Change|[CSF]|
|-------|---------------|-------------------------|
|Na<sup>+</sup>|-|140 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>|
|Cl<sup>-</sup>|↑|124 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>|
|K<sup>+</sup>|↓|2.9 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>|
|Gluc|↓|3.7 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>|
|pH|↓|7.32|
|Protein|↓|Variable*|
|Ca<sup>2+</sup>|↓|1.12 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>|
|Mg<sup>2+</sup>|↑|1.2 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>|
\* CSF [protein] is variable, being greatest in the lumbar sac and lowest in the ventricles, but is always lower than plasma [protein]. This means CSF is a **poor buffer solution**, which increases its sensitivity to derangements in respiratory acid-base status.

In summary, [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>-</sup>] is increased, [Na<sup>+</sup>] is unchanged, and everything else falls.

##Circulation
CSF flow is driven by respiratory oscillations, arterial pulsations, and ongoing production in the choroidal plexus.
* **Production** in the **choroidal plexus** in the **lateral ventricles**
* To the **third ventricle** via the **Foramen of Munro**
* To the **fourth ventricle** via the **Aqueduct of Sylvius**
* To the **cisterna magna** via the two lateral **Foramina of Luschka** and the midline **Foramen of Magendie**
* It may now pass either:
    * **Cranially**, to the **basilar cisterns** and via the **Sylvian fissure** to the **cortical regions**
    * **Caudally**, to the **spinal subarachoid space** via the **central canal**

##Reabsorption
Reabsorption of CSF occurs in the **arachnoid villi**, which are located in the **dural walls** of the **sagittal** and **sigmoid sinuses**. 85% of reabsorption occurs in intracranial arachnoid villi, with the remainder by spinal arachnoid villi. Reabsorption is predominantly via pinocytosis and opening of extracellular fluid spaces.

CSF reabsorption is **pressure-dependent**, and reabsorption occurs when the CSF pressure is **1.5mmHg greater** than venous pressure. Typically an ICP <7mmHg results in minimal CSF reabsorption. Above this, CSF absorption increases in a linear fashion up to 22.5mmHg.
