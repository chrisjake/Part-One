The pulmonary circulation is:
* A **low-pressure**, **high-flow**, high-pulsatility circulation
* Supplied by the pulmonary trunk (pressure 25/8 mmHg), driven by the RV (pressure 25/0 mmHg)
  * Arteries and veins run with the bronchi as far as the terminal bronchioles, dividing at the same points
  * Beyond this, they form a capillary bed so thin it is essentially sheet of flowing blood punctuated by alveoli

The **bronchial circulation**:
* Arises from the systemic circulation, and supplies blood to the conducting zone of the lung
* A third drains back to the systemic circulation
* The remainder drains into the pulmonary vessels - this is a **physiologic shunt**
  * Supply to tumours is predominantly from the bronchial circulation (rather than the pulmonary circulation) as these vessels respond to angiogenic factors.

##Differences between Pulmonary and Systemic Circulations
###Blood Pressure
Pulmonary arterial pressure is 25/8 mmHg (MAP 15 mmHg) compared to 120/80 mmHg (MAP 100 mmHg) in the systemic circulation. This is because the systemic circulation must:
* **Regulate flow** to different organs at different times  
  It therefore contains resistance vessels which allow it to allocate cardiac output accordingly.
* **Maintain flow** to organs far above the heart  

Conversely, the pulmonary circulation must:
* **Accept the entirety of cardiac output**, with little capacity to regulate flow (hypoxic vasoconstriction being the exception)
* **Minimise extravasation** of fluid  
    * As per Starlings Law, fluid movement out of the capillary is given by the difference in hydrostatic gradients and oncotic gradients
    * The net oncotic gradient is small (but favours reabsorption), however the pulmonary interstitium has **no hydrostatic pressure**
    * Increased pulmonary capillary presure therefore causes extravasation of large volumes of fluid


* Consequently, pulmonary vessels are thin walled and contain minimal smooth muscle
* This makes the pulmonary circulation **highly compliant** - the volume of blood is able to change substantially with minimal change in pressure

###Vascular Resistance
Vascular resistance follows Ohms law, i.e.:  
$$ Vascular \ Resistance = {P_{In} - P_{Out} \over Flow }$$

 * Pulmonary vascular resistance is ~1/10<sup>th</sup> that of the systemic circulation
   * This is because the pressure drop across the pulmonary circulation is  10mmHg (MAP - LAP), ~1/10<sup>th</sup> that of the systemic circulation, and flow is the same

Determinants of pulmonary vascular resistance are:
* **Pulmonary Artery Pressure**  
Increased PAP causes a decrease in PVR. This occurs because:
  * Previously closed pulmonary capillaries are recruited when their **critical opening pressure** is reached   
  This is more important when MPAP is low.
  * Vessels distend at higher pressures  
  This is more important when MPAP is high.

* **Lung volume**
Lung volume has a variable effect on PVR.
  * At large lung volumes:
    * Resistance in large extra-alveolar vessels decreases as the vessels are pulled opening by distension of elastic tissues
    * Resistance in small intra-alveolar vessels increases as they are compressed by the high lung volumes
  * At small lung volumes, the reverse occurs
 
 
 * **Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction**  
 Low **PAO<sub>2</sub>** causes a vasoconstriction in the vessels supplying that alveolus, increasing PVR and directing blood to better ventilated alveoli.
   * Low alveolar PO<sub>2</sub> is the primary determinant
   * Low mixed venous PO<sub>2</sub> also contributes
   * This is important in:
     * Foetal circulation
     * Alveolar consolidation
       * Pneumonia
       * Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema  
       Raised LVEDP increases pulmonary venous pressures. Basal alveoli are more affected. HPV causes constriction of basal vessels, increasing blood flow to apical alveoli and resulting in **upper lobe diversion** seen on chest x-ray.
     * High altitude 
 
 
 * **Minor factors** which affect PVR:
   * **Increase** PVR:
     * Hypercarbia
     * Hypothermia
     * Acidaemia
     * Pain
   * **Decrease** PVR:
     * Bronchodilators
     * Volatiles
 

###Distribution of Pulmonary Flow
In the upright lung, flow decreases almost linearly with height. In the supine lung, flow to posterior regions exceeds that of anterior regions. This occurs due to the low driving pressure of the pulmonary circulation, which means gravity has a significant affect on blood flow.

####West's Zones
In the upright lung, the hydrostatic pressure difference will be about 30cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, there may be a region where **alveolar pressure exceeds arterial pressure**. This does not occur in normal conditions, because a normal pulmonary artery pressure is normally (just) sufficient. However, if alveolar pressure is raised (e.g. IPPV), or arterial pressure falls (shock), this may occur. This is known as **West's Zone 1**, where:** PA > Pa > Pv**.

The alternative is that arterial pressure exceeds alveolar pressure. This is **West's Zone 2**, where: **Pa > PA > Pv**. Here, flow is determined by the arterial-alveolar pressure gradient rather than the arterial-venous gradient. This forms a **Starling Resistor**, where **flow is independent of downstream pressure**.

**Zone 3** occurs when alveolar pressure falls below venous pressure, i.e. **Pa > Pv > PA**. Flow is dependent on the arterial-venous pressure gradient. Capillary pressure increases along their length, increasing transmural pressure and mean width.

**Zone 4** occurs at low lung volumes, as extra-alveolar vessels collapse and blood flow no longer occurs. Effectively, **Pa > Pint > Pv > PA**. In effect, the interstitium is acting as a Starling resistor.

####Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction
Pulmonary resistance vessels constrict when the PO<sub>2</sub> of inspired gas is low. This is to prevent blood flow from poorly ventilated regions of the lung, and so improve V/Q mismatching. It has a powerful response, with PAO<sub>2</sub> of < 70mmHg causing marked vasoconstriction.

It also has relevance in two specific circumstances:
* At high altitude, the PAO<sub>2</sub> is globally reduced, leading to high pulmonary artery pressures
* In utero, PAO<sub>2</sub> is negligible, and PVR is therefore very high. This diverts blood from the pulmonary circulation into the left side of the heart via the foramen ovale. When the first breath is taken, pulmonary vessels dilate and the right-to-left shunt is reversed.
