# Cardiac Cycle
> Describe the normal pressure and flow patterns (including velocity profiles) of the cardiac cycle

The cardiac cycle:
* Describes sequence of events that occur in the heart over one beat
* Consists of **two phases** divided into **six stages**
* Typically is descried as beginning in **late diastole** when the myocardium is relaxed and the ventricles are passively filling

Phases of the cardiac cycle:
* Diastole
    * Isovolumetric Ventricular Relaxation
    * Rapid Ventricular Filling
    * Slow Ventricular Filling  
    (The cycle begins here).
    * Atrial Contraction
* Systole
    * Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction
    * Ejection

##Phases of the Cardiac Cycle
###Slow Ventricular Filling (Diastasis)
In slow ventricular filling:
* The AV valves are open and the semi-lunar valves are closed
* The ventricle is **relaxed completely** and fills slowly  
The ventricles have been mostly filled during rapid ventricular filling and so the pressure gradient is reducing.
    * The pressure in each ventricle is almost zero
* **Arterial pressure is falling**, as it is end-diastole
* **CVP is slowly rising** as the ventricle and atria fill  
This period occurs **after the y descent**.
* The **ECG** will show the beginnings of a **P-wave** at the end of this phase

###Atrial Contraction
The atria contract, and remaining blood in the atria is ejected into the ventricle. This supplies **10%** of the ventricular **filling at rest**, but up to **40% in tachycardia**.

In atrial contraction:
* **Arterial pressure** is still **falling**
* The **CVP** waveform demonstrates the **a** wave as atrial contraction also causes blood to reflux into the SVC
* The **ECG** will show the **PR interval**

###Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction
Once the action potential passes through the AV node and bundle of His, ventricular contraction begins.

In isovolumetric contraction:
* Ventricular pressure rises, and the **AV valves close**  
This gives rise to the first heart sound, S<sub>1</sub>.
    * As ventricular pressure is still less than systemic vascular pressure, the semilunar valves remain closed
* **Arterial pressure** is still **falling**
* The **CVP** waveform shows the **C** (closure) wave, as the tricuspid valve herniates back into the RA during ventricular contraction  
There is a similar spike in LA pressure as the mitral valve also bulges back into the LA.
* The **ECG** will show the remainder of the QRS or the start of the QT interval  
    * Atrial repolarisation occurs at this stage, but is typically masked by ventricular depolarisation


###Ejection
When ventricular pressure exceeds arterial pressure, the semilunar valves open and ejection occurs. **Initial ejection is rapid**, but as ventricular pressure falls and systemic pressure rises the gradient falls ejection becomes slower.

During ejection:
* **Arterial pressure rises rapidly**, and is equal to ventricular pressure during this stage
* The **CVP** waveform shows the **x descent**, as the shortening RV pulls the RA down, rapidly lowering CVP.
* The **ST segment** shows on the ECG as the ventricles are fully depolarised, though the  **T wave** may appear in late ejection.

###Isovolumetric Relaxation
When contraction is complete, the ventricles begin to relax. **Inertia** means thaT blood continues to eject for a short time, but when ventricular pressure falls below vascular pressure, the **semilunar valves close**. This gives rise to the second heart sound, S<sub>2</sub>. This marks the beginning of isovolumetric relaxation.

* **Arterial pressure begins to fall**, interrupted by the **dicrotic notch** which is a brief increase in arterial pressure as the semilunar valves close
* The **v wave** is visible on the CVP waveform occurs here as the atria fills against closed AV valves
* Ventricular repolarisation is completing at this time - the **end of the T wave** is visible on the ECG

###Rapid Ventricular Filling
As the ventricle relaxes and the atria fills, a point is reached where atrial pressure exceeds ventricular pressure. At this point the **AV valves open** and ventricular filling occurs. During early ventricular diastole the ventricle is **still relaxing** and so the **pressure gradient is maintained** and rapid filling occurs. Most of ventricular filling occurs in this phase.

* **Arterial pressure is falling**
* The **y descent** occurs when the AV valves open, causing a rapid drop in CVP as the ventricles fill
* No electrical activity is produced - the ECG shows the TP interval
