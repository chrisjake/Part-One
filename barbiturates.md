# Barbiturates
Thiopentone acts increasing the duration of cloride channel opening at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (at a separate site to benzodiazepines), enhancing the action of GABA.

|Property|Thiopentone
|--|--|
|**Class**|Barbiturate
|**Uses**|Induction of anaesthesia, status epilepticus, control of ICP refractory to other measures
|**Presentation**|500mg of yellow powder for reconstitution as a 2.5% solution. Container uses nitrogen as a filler gas (to prevent HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> formation when CO<sub>2</sub> combines with water when reconstituted. pH of 11 when reconstituted - bacteriostatic solution.
|**Route of Administration**|IV
|**Dosing**|3-7mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>. Consider 75mg boluses, assessing haemodynamic and neuronal effects.
|**Distribution**|Rapid initial distribution gives a reliable, rapid offset. Slow redistribution and prolonged elimination half life contribute to long CSHT. Increased unionised portion in acidosis. t<sub>1/2<sub>ke0</sub> of 1.2 minutes.
|**Metabolism**|Capacity dependent hepatic metabolism - saturatable at high doses (long CSHT with infusion). Metabolised to (active) **pentobarbital**, which also increases the duration of its clinical effects.
|**Elimination**|Renal of metabolites
|**Resp**|Respiratory depression, bronchospasm, laryngospasm
|**CVS**|Vasodilation, ↓ inotropy, with compensatory tachycardia (baroreceptor response preserved)
|**CNS**|Hyponosis and anaesthesia within 40 seconds of injection, with reliable loss of lash reflex. ↓ CBF, ↓ ICP, ↓ CMRO<sub>2</sub>, anticonvulsant, progressive flattening of EEG leading to burst suppression) 
|**Endocrine**|↓ RBF causing ↓ UO
|**GIT**|Hepatic enzyme induction
|**Immune**|Analphylaxis ~1;20,000
|**Metabolic**|May precipitate acute **porphyric** crises and is **contraindicated** in these patients
|**Other**|Intraarterial injection causes microembolisation and ischaemia
