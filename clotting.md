# Haemostasis
> Describe the process and regulation of haemostasis, coagulation ~~and fibrinolysis~~

Haemostasis describes the physiological processes that occur to stop bleeding. It involves three processes:
* **Vessel constriction**  
  Decreases flow, which limits further haemorrhage and reduces the shear stresses which break up forming clot
* **Platelet plug formation** or Primary Haemostasis  
    Platlets adhere to the damaged vessel wall and aggregate
* **Fibrin formation** or Secondary Haemostasis  
    Fibrin is formed from fibrinogen (via the coagulation cascade), which stabilises the platelet plug


##Primary Haemostasis
Following a vascular injury, the exposure of subendothelial proteins stimulates platelets to form an occlusive plug via several processes:

* **Adhesion**  
    Exposed collagen binds to GPIa receptor on platelets.  
    vWF also binds to platelets.

* **Activation**  
    Metabolic activation via collagen, adrenaline, ADP, and thrombin, which activate phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and phopholipase C, increasing platelet intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and initiating a transformation from a disc to a sphere with long projections.

    Platelets also release ADP and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> from their **alpha granules** and **dense bodies**, amplifying further platelet aggregation and adhesion.
    
* **Aggregation**  
With other platelets - held together by fibrin - forming a plug.

* **Contraction**  
  After some time platelets contract, retracting the clot and sealing the wall

##Secondary Haemostasis
The coagulation cascade is an amplifification mechanism which circularly activates clotting factors in order to produce fibrin.

INSERT COAGULATION CASCADE

Participating factors in the coagulation cascade can be either **enzymes** or **cofactors**:
* Enzymes circulate in their inactive form, and become active (VII â‡’ VIIa) when hydrolysed by their precusor factor
* Cofactors amplify the cascade

###Pathways
The cascade is divided into the **intrinsic pathway** and **extrinsic pathway**, which join to form the **common pathway**. *In vitro*, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways operate separately. This is an artifact of lab measurement - *in vivo* **the pathways are co-dependent**.

####Extrinsic Pathway
The extrinsic pathway contains two factors:
* Tissue Factor
* Factor VII

Tissue factor is a membrane protein on sub-endothelial cells, which is exposed when the vessel is damaged (it is found in a few other places as well). It binds to factor VII to form VIIa.

####Intrinsic Pathway
The intrinsic pathway contains:
* (HMWK)
* (Factor XII)
* Factor XI
* Factor IX
* Factor VIII  
vWF is bound to factor VIII in circulation, preventing it from degradation.

Thrombin is the main activator of the intrinsic pathway *in vivo*. The contact factors (HMWK, Factor XII) are only important *in vitro* when conducting lab testing - deficiency of these factors does not cause a coagulopathy.

HMWK activates factor XII, factor XIIa activates factor IX (as does thrombin). Factor VIII circulates in a complex with vWF. When activated by thrombin, it acts as a cofactor for factor IXa to activate factor X.

####Common Pathway
The common pathway contains:
* Factor X
* Factor V
* Factor II (prothrombin)
* Factor I (fibrinogen)

Factor V is a cofactor (similar to factor VIII), which when activated by thrombin allows factor Xa to convert prothrombin into thrombin.


##The Cell-Based Model of Coagulation
* The cascade model (above) accurately describes the process of clotting *in vitro*, but not *in vivo*
* The cell-based model has several changes, noting the central role of thep platelet:
  * **Initiation phase**  
  Coagulation begins with tissue factor being exposed, which also activates platelets.
  * **Amplification phase**  
  A positive feedback loop occurs:
    * Production of Xa causes production of thrombin (IIa), **priming** the system
    * Thrombin then activates factors V, VIII, and IX, accelerating Xa production and further thrombin generation
  * **Propagation phase**  
  Platelets bind activated clotting factors, causing high rates of thrombin formation around them.
