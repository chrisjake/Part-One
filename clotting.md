# Haemostasis
> Describe the process and regulation of haemostasis, coagulation ~~and fibrinolysis~~

Haemostasis describes the physiological processes that occur to stop bleeding. It involves three processes:
* **Vessel constriction**  
  Decreases flow, which limits further haemorrhage and reduces the shear stresses which break up forming clot
* **Platelet plug formation** or Primary Haemostasis  
    Platlets adhere to the damaged vessel wall and aggregate
* **Fibrin formation** or Secondary Haemostasis  
    Fibrin is formed from fibrinogen (via the coagulation cascade), which stabilises the platelet plug


##Primary Haemostasis
Following a vascular injury, the exposure of subendothelial proteins stimulates platelets to form an occlusive plug via several processes:

* **Adhesion**  
    Exposed collagen binds to GPIa receptor on platelets.  
    vWF also binds to platelets.

* **Activation**  
    Metabolic activation via collagen, adrenaline, ADP, and thrombin, which activate phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and phopholipase C, increasing platelet intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and initiating a transformation from a disc to a sphere with long projections.

    Platelets also release ADP and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> from their **alpha granules** and **dense bodies**, amplifying further platelet aggregation and adhesion.
    
* **Aggregation**  
With other platelets - held together by fibrin - forming a plug.

* **Contraction**  
  After some time platelets contract, retracting the clot and sealing the wall

##Secondary Haemostasis
The coagulation cascade is an amplification mechanism which activates clotting factors in order to produce fibrin.

Participating factors in the coagulation cascade can be either **enzymes** or **cofactors**:
* Enzymes circulate in their inactive form, and become active (e.g. VII â‡’ VIIa) when hydrolysed by their precusor factor
* Cofactors amplify the cascade

###Pathways
The cascade is divided into the **intrinsic pathway** and **extrinsic pathway**, which join to form the **common pathway**. *In vitro*, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways operate separately. This is an artifact of lab measurement - *in vivo* **the pathways are co-dependent**.

####Extrinsic Pathway
The extrinsic pathway contains two factors, and the process of activation **occurs in seconds**:
* Tissue Factor  
Membrane protein on sub-endothelial cells, which is exposed when the vessel is damaged (it is found in a few other places as well). It binds to factor VII to form VIIa, and thus activates the extrinsic pathway.
* Factor VII

####Intrinsic Pathway
The intrinsic pathway is activated **over minutes**, and contains:
* Contact factors  
Only important *in vitro* when conducting lab testing - deficiency of these factors does not cause a coagulopathy.
  * HMWK  
  HMWK activates factor XII.
  * Factor XII  
  Factor XIIa activates factor IX, as does thrombin.
* Factor XI
* Factor IX
* Factor VIII  
Factor VIII circulates in a complex with vWF, preventing it from degradation. When activated by thrombin, it acts as a cofactor for factor IXa to activate factor X.

The intrinsic pathway is activated by:
* Thrombin  
Main activator of the intrinsic pathway *in vivo*.
* Collagen
* Glass  
In vitro.

####Common Pathway
The common pathway contains:
* Factor X
* Factor V  
Cofactor (similar to factor VIII), which when activated by thrombin allows factor Xa to convert prothrombin into thrombin.
* Factor II (prothrombin)  
Has several key roles:
  * Cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin
  * Activates factor XIII  
  Factor XIIIa stabilises clot by forming crossbridges between fibrin in a platelet plug.
  * Amplification of the clotting cascade by activating factors V and VIII
  * Activates protein C  
  Thrombin binds with thombomodulin to form a complex which inhibits coagulation.
* Factor I (fibrinogen)


##The Cell-Based Model of Coagulation
* The cascade model (above) accurately describes the process of clotting *in vitro*, but not *in vivo*
* The cell-based model has several changes, noting the central role of thep platelet:
  * **Initiation phase**  
  Coagulation begins with tissue factor being exposed, which also activates platelets.
  * **Amplification phase**  
  A positive feedback loop occurs:
    * Production of Xa causes production of thrombin (IIa), **priming** the system
    * Thrombin then activates factors V, VIII, and IX, accelerating Xa production and further thrombin generation
  * **Propagation phase**  
  Platelets bind activated clotting factors, causing high rates of thrombin formation around them.
