# Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

Angiotensin receptor antagonists are very similar to ACE inhibitors, except:
* Bradykinin does not accumulate as it is still broken down by ACE  
Therefore there is no cough and compliance is improved.
* The AT<sub>1</sub> receptor in cardiac tissue is more comprehensively blocked which *may* improve cardiac outcomes
* The AT<sub>2</sub> receptor is not blocked, which *may* also improve cardiac outcomes
