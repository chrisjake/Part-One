#Variations in Upper Airway Anatomy
>Understand the differences encountered in the upper airway for neonates, children and adults.

##Neonates
* Proportionally **enlarged head** that tends to flex a proportionally **short neck**, which favours airway obstruction
* Disproportionately **large tongue** that complicates laryngoscopy
* **Epiglottis** is **longer and stiffer**, and the **larynx lies at C4** (rather than C6 in adults)
* Intrathoracic trachea is also shorter, leaving little margin for error in tube placement.

* Airways themselves are narrower, and have a higher resistance to flow. 

* Most of these changes have resolved by ~8 years of age.
