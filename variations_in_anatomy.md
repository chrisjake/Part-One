#Variations in Upper Airway Anatomy
>Understand the differences encountered in the upper airway for neonates, children and adults.

##Neonates
* Obligate nose breathers  
Nasal obstruction may significantly impair respiration.
* Proportionally **enlarged head** and occiput  
Optimal intubating position is neutral rather than ramped.
* Proportionally **short neck**  
Favours airway obstruction.
* Disproportionately **large tongue** that complicates laryngoscopy
* **Epiglottis** is **u-shaped**, **longer**, and **stiffer**
* **Larynx lies at C4** (rather than C6 in adults)
* Narrowest part of the trachea is at the cricoid  
Oedema due to trauma may rapidly cause airway obstruction.
* Intrathoracic trachea is also shorter  
May be only 4cm long, so there is little margin for error in tube placement.
* Left and right bronchi arise at similar angles, so endobronchial intubation may occur on either side


* Airways themselves are narrower, and have a higher resistance to flow. 



* Most of these changes have resolved by ~8 years of age.
