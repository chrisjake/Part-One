# Part One

These are my notes for the CICM primary, which I sat in Feb/April 2016. At present, they are:
* A bit incomplete
* Not fully checked for typos
* Lacking graphs

They will (hopefully) be revised in the coming months, as I get my head around JS and start the buildup for the anaesthetic primary exam.

At the moment they are delivered as-is. Incomplete, but hopefully better than nothing.
