# Part One

These are my notes for the CICM primary, which I sat in Feb/April 2016. At present, they are:
* A bit incomplete
* Not fully checked for typos
* Lacking graphs

They will (hopefully) be revised in the coming months, as I get my head around JS and start the buildup for the anaesthetic primary exam.

At the moment they are delivered as-is. Incomplete, but hopefully better than nothing.

##How to Use Part One
I will have benefited far more from writing these notes than you will through reading them. However, you **should** use them:
* To look up something you need an answer to quickly  
The search function is pretty good.
* As a rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
* As a method to correct your own written exam answers

**Don't** use them:
* As a replacement for your own study
* As a sole resource
