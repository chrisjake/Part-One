# Part One

Part One is a reference for trainees preparing for the CICM and ANZCA Primary Exams.
* Part One **is**:
    * Designed to cover the *assessed* sections of the CICM and ANZCA curricula
    * Designed to do so in enough detail to pass
* Part One **is not**:
    * A medical textbook
    * A complete reference  
    There will be errors. If you find any, please let us know.
    


##How to Use Part One
I will have benefited far more from writing these notes than you will through reading them. However, they should be useful:
* As a quick reference for something you need an answer to quickly  
The search function is pretty good.
* As a rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
* As a method to correct your own written exam answers


**Don't** use them:
* As a replacement for your own study
* As a sole resource

###Layout
The book is divided into three sections:
* **Curriculum**  
Covers statistics, physiology, equipment and measurement, and anatomy.
    * Pages are laid out using the section and topic titles and the order from the CICM curriculum (it is laid out better than the ANZCA curriculum)
    * When a topic is only examinable in the ANZCA curriculum, it has been slotted in somewhere sensible
    * Topics covered by the page are listed at the beginning of each page
> A grey block indicates a topic is from the CICM curriculum OR both curricula
> <p style="color:purple";>A purple block indicates a topic is ONLY from the ANZCA curriculum</p>

        
* **Pharmacopia**  
Covers drugs.
    * For the sake of consistency, the *general principles* of pharmacology are covered in the curriculum, whilst the specifics of different agents will be found in the pharmacopia. If lost, use the search box.

    
* **Appendices**  
Has a list of common abbreviations, definitions, graphs and equations you should know, and sample structures for SAQs.
