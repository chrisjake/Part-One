# Part One

Part One is a reference for trainees preparing for the CICM and ANZCA Primary Exams.
* Part One **is** designed to cover the *assessed* sections of the CICM and ANZCA curricula **in enough detail to pass**. Use it as:
    * A rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
    * A tool to correct your written answers
    * A source of information you might find difficult to find elsewhere
* Part One **is not**:
    * A textbook
    * The definitive guide to the primary exam  
    * A complete reference  
    There will be both omissions and errors. If you find any, please let us know.
    

##Layout
The book is divided into three sections:
* **Curriculum**  
Covers statistics, physiology, equipment and measurement, and anatomy.
    * Pages are laid out using the section title, topic titles, and order from the CICM curriculum  
    > A grey block indicates a topic is from the CICM curriculum OR both curricula
    * When a topic is only examinable in the ANZCA curriculum, it has been slotted in somewhere sensible
    > <p style="color:purple";>A purple block indicates a topic is ONLY from the ANZCA curriculum</p>
    * Topics covered by the page are listed at the beginning of each page



        
* **Pharmacopia**  
Covers drugs.
    * For the sake of consistency, the *general principles* of pharmacology are covered in the curriculum, whilst the specifics of different agents will be found in the pharmacopia. If lost, use the search box.

    
* **Appendices**  
Includes the key definitions, graphs, and equations you should know, as well as sample structures for SAQs.
