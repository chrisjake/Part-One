    * Designed to bring together information from a wide variety of sources  
    In enough depth to pass.  
        * Use it as a rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
        * Use it to correct your written answers
        * Use it to find information you might find difficult to find elsewhere
* Part One **is not**:
    * A medical textbook
    * The definitive guide to the primary exam  
    Do not use it as a sole resource. Read widely.
    * A complete reference  
    There will be errors. If you find any, please let us know.
    

##Layout
The book is divided into three sections:
* **Curriculum**  
Covers statistics, physiology, equipment and measurement, and anatomy.
    * Pages are laid out using the section title, topic titles, and order from the CICM curriculum  
    > A grey block indicates a topic is from the CICM curriculum OR both curricula
    * When a topic is only examinable in the ANZCA curriculum, it has been slotted in somewhere sensible
    > <p style="color:purple";>A purple block indicates a topic is ONLY from the ANZCA curriculum</p>
    * Topics covered by the page are listed at the beginning of each page



        
* **Pharmacopia**  
Covers drugs.
    * For the sake of consistency, the *general principles* of pharmacology are covered in the curriculum, whilst the specifics of different agents will be found in the pharmacopia. If lost, use the search box.

    
* **Appendices**  
Has a list of common abbreviations, definitions, graphs and equations you should know, and sample structures for SAQs.
