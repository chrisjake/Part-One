# Part One

These are my notes for the CICM primary, which I sat in Feb/April 2016. At present, they are:
* A bit incomplete
* Not fully checked for typos
* Lacking graphs

They will (hopefully) be revised in the coming months, as I get my head around JS and start the buildup for the anaesthetic primary exam.

At the moment they are delivered as-is. Incomplete, but hopefully better than nothing.

##How to Use Part One
I will have benefited far more from writing these notes than you will through reading them. However, they should be useful:
* As a quick reference for something you need an answer to quickly  
The search function is pretty good.
* As a rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
* As a method to correct your own written exam answers


**Don't** use them:
* As a replacement for your own study
* As a sole resource

###Layout
The book is divided into three sections:
* **Curriculum**  
This covers statistics, physiology, equipment and measurement, and anatomy.
    * Pages are laid out using the section and topic titles and the order from the CICM curriculum (it is laid out better than the ANZCA curriculum)
    * When a topic is only examinable in the ANZCA curriculum, it has been slotted in somewhere sensible
    * Topics covered by the page are listed at the beginning of each page 
    > A grey block indicates a topic is from the CICM or both curricula
    <!--></!-->
    > <p style="color:purple";>A purple block indicates a topic is ONLY from the ANZCA curriculum</p>
        
    
* **Pharmacopia**  
This covers drugs.
    * For the sake of consistency, the "physiological" bits of pharmacology are found in the curriculum, i.e. "factors which affect neuromuscular blockade" will be found in the curriculum, whilst a "comparison of neuromuscular blockers" will be found in the pharmacopia. If lost, use the search box.
    
    
* **Appendices**  
This has a list of common abbreviations, definitions, graphs and equations you should know, and sample structures for SAQs.

A  subheadings indicate which curriculum this topic is relevant too:
> A grey subheading is either the CICM or both curricula
> <p style="color:purple";>A purple topic </p>
