# Local Anaesthetics

* Local anaesthetic drugs deliver a use-dependent, temporary blockade of neuronal transmission
* **Unionised** drug **passes through the cell membrane**, and then becomes **ionised intracellularly**
* The ionised drug is then able to bind to the sodium channel, and prevent conduction of sodium and therefore generation of an action potential
* An alternative suggested mechanism of action is the drug enters the cell membrane and mechanically distorts the channel


* All local anaesthetics consist of:
  * A hydrophilic component
  * A lipophilic aromatic ring
  * An amide or ester link connecting the two


##Common Features of Local Anaesthetics
|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Amide (-NHCO-) or Ester (-CCO-)
|**Pharmaceutics**|Amides are stable in solution, esters are unstable in solution
|**pKa**|All are weak bases, and have a pKa > 7.4
|**Onset**|Onset is related to dose (Fick's Law) and pKa, with a **low pKa** giving a **faster onset** as there is more unionised drug present and therefore more drug able to cross the cell membrane. This is why local anaesthetics are poor at anaesthetising infected tissues, as the tissue pH is low resulting in a greater proportion of ionised drug, and less drug reaching the effect site.
|**Duration of Action**|Duration of action is related to protein binding, with **greater protein binding** giving a **longer duration of action**
|**Potency**|Potency is related to lipid solubility (**higher lipid solubility increases potency**) and vasodilator properties (**weaker vasodilators having greater potency**)
|**Absorption**|Systemic absorption **varies with site of entry** (from highest absorption to lowest: IV, intercostal, caudal epidural, lumbar epidural, brachial plexus, subcutaneous), **dose**, and **presence of vasoconstrictors**
|**Distribution**|Amides are extensively protein bound, esters are minimally bound
|**Metabolism**|Amides are hepatically metabolised, esters are hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterases (giving a much shorter t<sub>1/2</sub>)
|**CVS**|Vasodilatation at low concentrations, vasoconstriction at high concentrations. Inhibition of cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channels, inhibiting maximum rate of rise of phase 0 of the cardiac action potential. Negative inotropy proportional to potency
|**CNS**|Does-dependent CNS effects: circumoral tingling, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremors, dizziness, slurred speech, convulsions, coma, apnoea. Potentiated by other CNS depressants and hypercarbia (due to ↑CBF and ↓ seizure threshold).
|**Toxic Effects**|Esters have a higher incidence of **allergy**. Local anaesthetic toxicity is predominantly CNS and CVS. Toxicity is compared using the **CC/CNS ratio** - the ratio  of the dose of drug required to cause cardiovascular collapse (CC) compared to the dose required to cause seizure - a crude alternative to the therapeutic index as a tool to classify safety of local anaesthetic agents. Toxicity is treated with intralipid 20% 1.5ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> over 1 minute, followed by infusion at 0.25ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>.

|**Distribution**|70% protein bound|Highly protein bound|Lower lipid solubility reduces motor block compared to bupivacaine|Highly protein bound
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic with some active metabolites|Hepatic to inactive metabolites|Hepatic to active metabolites|Plasma esterases, some hepatic metabolism (unlike other esters)
