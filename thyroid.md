# Thyroid
> Describe the control, secretions and functions of the thyroid.

The thyroid gland:
* Produces and secretes two hormones in response to TSH:
  * T<sub>4</sub> (thyroxine, 93%)
  * T<sub>3</sub> (tri-iodothyronine, 7%)
* Secretions are controlled via a negative-feedback loop on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis  
Increased TSH results in:
  * Increased iodine uptake
  * Increased iodination to form T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>
  * Increased proteolysis of thyroglobulin, which releases T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>
* Secretions are decreased with decreased iodine uptake
  * Percholate  
  Blocks Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> symporter.
  * Wolff-Chaikoff effect  
  A reduction in thyroid hormone production due to a high circulating [iodide].


##Synthesis
Thyroid hormones are:
* **Synthesised** in **follicles**  
A follicle is formed of a single layer of cuboidal epithelium around a central lumen (follicular cavity) containing thyroglobulin.
  * **Iodide** is transported into follicular cells via a **secondary active transport** mechanism  
  Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> co-transporter.
  * Iodide is then **oxidised to iodine**
  * Thyroglobulin is synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum of the follicular cell and excreted into the follicular cavity
  * Iodine is excreted into the follicular cavity using a chloride exchange pump
  * In the follicular cavity:
    * **Thyroid peroxidase** catalyses the iodination of thyroglobulin, forming mono-iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine
    * These are subsequently **oxidised**, forming T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> respectively

###In summary:
* Iodide is taken into the thyroid follicles by secondary active transport, and oxidised to iodine
* Thyroglobulin is synthesised in the follicle, and excreted into the follicular cavity
* Iodine is secreted into the follicular cavity, where it combines with thyroglobulin to produce T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>

##Secretion and Metabolism
Thyroid hormones are:
* Secreted in vesicles via endocytosis into the surrounding capillaries
  * Colloid enters thyroid cell via pinocytosis at the apical membrane
  * Vesicles then fuse with lysosomes
  * Thyroid hormone cleaved from thyroglobulin by proteases
  * Free T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> diffuse through the base of the thyroid cell into surrounding capillaries
* Highly protein bound to albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin
  * T<sub>4</sub> has a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 7 days
  * T<sub>3</sub> has a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 24 hours
  * Both are deiodinated in the liver, kidney, and muscle
    * 55% of T<sub>4</sub> will be first deiodinated to T<sub>3</sub>

##Physiological Effects
Thyroid hormones:
* Act on thyroid receptors in the **cell nucleus**  
Increasing gene transcription, protein synthesis, and mitochondria size and number. 
* **T<sub>3</sub> is 3-5x more active than T<sub>4</sub>**

Effects of thyroid hormone are predominantly metabolic:

|System|Effect|
|--|--|
|**Resp**| ↑ MV due to ↑ CO<sub>2</sub> production
|**CVS**|↑ HR, ↑ inotropy, ↑ CO, ↓ SVR, ↓ DBP
|**CNS**|↑ Excitability: Seizures, tremor
|**MSK**|↑ Osteoblastic activity
|**GU**|Impotence (men), oligomenorrhoea (women)
|**GIT**|↑ GIT motility
|**Metabolic**|↑ BMR up to 100%, ↑ carbohydrate metabolism (↑ glucose uptake, ↑ glycolysis, ↑ gluconeogenesis), ↑ fat metabolism (↑ lipolysis, ↑ non-shivering thermogenesis, ↓ plasma cholesterol, ↓ plasma phospholipids, ↓ triglycerides), ↑ protein metabolism (↑ anabolism at physiological levels, ↑ catabolism at high levels)
