# Thyroid
> Describe the control, secretions and functions of the thyroid.

The thyroid gland produces and secretes two hormones, T<sub>4</sub> (thyroxine, 93%) and T<sub>3</sub> (tri-iodothyronine, 7%), in response to TSH. This is controlled via a negative-feedback loop on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Increased TSH results in:
* Increased iodine uptake
* Increased iodination to form T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>
* Increased proteolysis of thyroglobulin, which releases T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>


Conversely, decreasing these mechanisms decreases thyroid hormone synthesis:
* Decreased iodine uptake
  * Percholate (blocks Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> symporter
  * Wolff-Chaikoff effect: A reduction in uptake due to a high circulating [iodide]


##Synthesis
Thyroid hormones are **synthesised** in **follicles**, formed of a single layer of cuboidal epithelium around a central lumen (follicular cavity) containing thyroglobulin. **Iodide** is transported into follicular cells via a **secondary active transport** mechanism, using an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump to remove Na<sup>+</sup> from the cell, and a Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> co-transporter to transport iodine down the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient.

Iodide is then **oxidised to iodine**. Thyroglobulin is synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum of the follicular cell and excreted into the follicular cavity. Iodine is excreted into the follicular cavity using a chloride exchange pump. In the cavity, **thyroid peroxidase** catalyses the iodination of thyroglobulin, forming mono-iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine. These are subsequently **oxidised**, forming T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> respectively.

###In summary:
* Iodide is taken into the thyroid follicles by secondary active transport, and oxidised to iodine
* Thyroglobulin is synthesised in the follicle, and excreted into the follicular cavity
* Iodine is secreted into the follicular cavity, where it combines with thyroglobulin to produce T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>

##Secretion and Metabolism
Thyroid hormones are secreted in vesicles via endocytosis into the surrounding capillaries.

Both are highly protein bound to albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin. T<sub>4</sub> has a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 7 days, whilst T<sub>3</sub> has a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 24 hours. Both are deiodinated in the liver, kidney, and muscle. 55% of T<sub>4</sub> will be deiodinated first to T<sub>3</sub>.

##Physiological Effects
Thyroid hormones act on thyroid receptors in the **cell nucleus**, increasing gene transcription, protein synthesis, and mitochondria size and number. **T<sub>3</sub> is 3-5x more active than T<sub>4</sub>**.

Effects of thyroid hormone are predominantly metabolic

|System|Effect|
|--|--|
|**Resp**| ↑ MV due to ↑ CO<sub>2</sub> production
|**CVS**|↑ HR, ↑ inotropy, ↑ CO, ↓ SVR, ↓ DBP
|**CNS**|↑ Excitability: Seizures, tremor
|**MSK**|↑ Osteoblastic activity
|**GU**|Impotence (men), oligomenorrhoea (women)
|**GIT**|↑ GIT motility
|**Metabolic**|↑BMR up to 100%, ↑ carbohydrate metabolism (↑ glucose uptake, ↑ glycolysis, ↑ gluconeogenesis), ↑ fat metabolism (↑ lipolysis, ↑ non-shivering thermogenesis, ↓ plasma cholesterol, ↓ plasma phospholipids, ↓ triglycerides), ↑ protein metabolism (↑ anabolism at physiological levels, ↑ catabolism at high levels)
