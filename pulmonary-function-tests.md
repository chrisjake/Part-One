#Pulmonary Function Tests

> Describe the measurement and interpretation of pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity.

Pulmonary function tests are performd with a **spirometer**, which measures either volume or flow (integrated for time) to quantify lung function.

Basic spirometry can be used to quantify:
* Lung volumes and capacities  
All except residual volume (and therefore FRC and TLC).
* Dynamic measurements
    * FEV<sub>1</sub>
    * FVC
    * PEFR
    * Flow-volume loop

Additional testing can be performed to measure:
* Residual volume  
FRC and TLC can therefore be calculated.
* Diffusion capacity
