# Erythrocytes {#id}
> Outline the physiological production of blood and its constituents

Erythrocytes:
* Are **7.5Î¼m diameter** (2um thick)
* Have a lifespan of **120 days**
* Have:
    * No nucleus  
    Maximises cell volume available for Hb.
    * No mitochondria  
    Cannot perform aerobic metabolism - all ATP is generated via glycolysis.
    * No ribosomes
    Incapable of producing protein
* Have a **biconcave disc** shape  
This maximises surface area (optimising gas transfer) and makes the cells flexible enough to pass through capillary beds (which are narrower than the cell).
* Are important in:
    * Delivering O<sub>2</sub> to the tissues and delivering CO<sub>2</sub> to the lungs
    * Acid-Base balance
    * Metabolism of some drugs
* Carry ~29pg of haemoglobin
* Make up 40-50% of blood volume

##Production
Erythrocytes have a **myeloid progenitor** which differentiates into the myeloid line.
* Erythrogenesis is stimulated by EPO  
In the adult, EPO is released from the:
  * 85% peritubular capillary fibroblasts
  * 15% in the liver
* EPO is released in response to:
    * Hypoxia
    * Hypotension
    * Low Hct
* EPO stimulates myeloid progenitor cells to:
  * Differentiate
  * Proliferate

* Proerythroblasts begin synthesis of Hb, with ongoing production occurring until the cell is mature
* Further differentiation results in successive **loss of organelles**, **increasing Hb content**
* The loss of **ribosomes** and **nucleus** of the reticulocyte are the final stage of erythropoiesis
* The entire process takes ~7-10 days


##Function
* Gas Carriage
* Acid-Base Buffering
    * Production of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
    * Binding of H<sup>+</sup> to Hb
* Metabolism  
Esterases (and other -ases) in erythrocytes metabolise many drugs, including:
    * Remifentanil
    * SNP (reacts with Hb to form NO, CN, and Met-Hb)
    * Esmolol
