#Principles of Ultrasound
> Describe the physical principles of ultrasound and the Doppler Effect.

Ultrasound is an imaging technique where high-frequency sound waves (2-15MHz) are used to generate an image. An ultrasound wave is produced by a probe using the **piezoelectric effect**. Certain crystalline structures will generate a voltage when they vibrate at a particular frequency. Similarly, they will vibrate at a particular frequency when a certain voltage is applied across them. The conversion of electrical energy to potential energy allows the ultrasound probe to create an ultrasound wave.

##Basic principles
* **Spatial resolution** is how close two separate objects can be to each other and still be distinguishable. It is divided into:
    * **Axial resolution**, how far apart two objects can be when one is above the other (in the direction of the beam)
    * **Lateral resolution**, how far apart two objects can be when side side-by-side
* Contrast resolution is how similar two objects can appear (in echogenic appearance) and still be distinguishable

**Higher frequency** settings offer **greater spatial resolution** but **decreased penentration**. **Lower frequency** settings offer **reduced spatial resolution** but **increased penetration**, and are used for visualising deep structures. 

##Affect of Tissues on Ultrasound
Sound travels through tissues at a **depth propotional to frequency**. At tissue interfaces, the wave may be **absorbed**, **reflected**, **transmitted** through the interface, or **scattered**.

* **Absorbed** sound is lost as heat, and increases with decreased water content of tissues.
* **Reflected** sound bounces back from the tissue interface, and returns to the probe. Reflection is dependent upon the **difference in sound conduction** between the two tissues, the **angle of incidence** (close to 90° improves reflection), and the **smoothness** of the tissue plane.
    * The amplitude of sound returning to the probe determines echogenicity, or how white the object will be displayed.
    * The time taken for the sound to return determines depth. As $$s = {d \over t} $$, then $$ d = st $$. Speed of sound in the body is assumed to be 1540 ms<sup>-1</sup>, therefore the time taken for a wave to return is proportional to **twice** the distance of the object from the probe.
* **Transmitted** sound passes through the tissue, and may be reflected or absorbed at deeper tissues.
* **Scattered** sound is reflected from tissue but is not received by the probe.

**Attenuation** describes the loss of sound wave with increasing depth, and is a function of the above. It can be managed by increasing the **gain**, which is amplification of returned signal. **Time-gain compensation** refers to amplification of signals which have taken longer to return, thus amplifying signals returned from deep tissues.

##Modes
**B-Mode** is the standard 2D ultrasound mode, and plots the measured amplitude of reflected ultrasound waves by the calculated depth from which they were reflected. 

**M-Mode** reflects motion of the heart structures. 


##Doppler Effect
The doppler effect is the change in observed frequency when a wave is reflected (or emitted from) a moving object, relative to the position of the receiver. In medical ultrasound, it is the change in frequency of sound reflected from a moving erythrocyte. It is given by the equation:

$$ V = { \Delta Fs \over 2F_0cos\theta} $$ where: 

$$ V $$ = Velocity of object  
$$ F $$ = Frequency shift  
$$ s $$ = Speed of sound (in blood)  
$$ F_0 $$ = Frequency of the emitted sound  
$$ \theta $$ = Angle between the sound wave and the object

Reflected frequencies are **higher towards the probe** and **lower away**.

Knowledge of the above allows velocity to be determined (θ is assumed). Combined with knowledge of the cross-sectional area of a vessel (obtained by measuring the diameter using ultrasound), flow can be determined.
