#Total Intravenous Anaesthesia and Target-Controlled Infusion
> <p style="color:purple";>Describe the pharmacological principles of and sources of error with target controlled infusion</p>

Total intravenous anaesthesia involves using IV agents alone to achieve hypnosis, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. TIVA:
* Advantages
    * Avoids adverse effects of anaesthetic agents
        * Nausea/vomiting
        * Pollution
* Disadvantages
    * Drug must be metabolised
    * Potential increased liklihood of awareness
        * Likely related to poor application of technique rather than the technique itself
            * Mostly related to disconnection of infusion without EEG monitoring
        * Varible plasma concentration


##Target Controlled Infusion
TCI is the use of pharmacokinetic models (typically combined with microprocessor-controlled infusion pumps) to achieve a target plasma or effect site concentration of drug.

Method of TCI:
* A loading dose is given to saturate the volume of distribution to achieve target concentration  
$$Loading \ Dose = V_D \times C_T$$
* Infusion rate is then set to maintain a target plasma concentration:  
$$Maintenance \ Infusion \ Rate \ (MIR) = Cl \times C_T$$
    * Rate compensates for:
        * Drug elimination
        * Drug distribution
* Adjusting $$C_T$$:
    * For a higher concentration:
        * A small bolus is given
        * Infusion rate is increased
    * For a lower concentration:
        * Infusion is paused until desired level is reached
        * Infusion rate restarts at a lower rate

###TCI Models for Propofol
The Bristol Model:
* First pharmacokinetic model
* Based on three-compartment model of health patients
* Assumes:
    * Premedication with temazepam
    * Fentanyl 3μg.kg<sup>-1</sup> on induction
    * Inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O
    * A target plasma concentration ($$C_P$$) of 3μg.ml<sup>-1</sup>
* The model:
    * 1mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> induction bolus
    * 10-8-6 maintenance:
        * 10mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.hr<sup>-1</sup> for 10 minutes
        * 8mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.hr<sup>-1</sup> for 10 minutes
        * 6mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.hr<sup>-1</sup> thereafter
        
The Marsh Model:
* Targets $$C_P$$
* Uses:
    * Total body weight  
    Over-estimates dose in obese patients.
        * Consider using ideal body weight instead
    * Age  
    Pumps will not run if age > 16, however age is not included in the calculation.
* Calculates:
* Pros:
    * Rapid onset
* Cons:
    * Risk of overdose in obese and elderly patients


The Schnider Model:
* Targets $$C_e$$
