#The Cell Membrane {#id}
> Describe the cell membrane and cellular organelles and their properties.

Cell membranes are:
* Formed by a **phospholipid bilayer**  
Separates the intracellular and extracellular fluid.
* **Semi-permeable**  
Leads to different ionic concentrations (and therefore electrical charge) on either side of the membrane.
    * Alteration in charge means the membrane acts as a **capacitor**, with most cells having a **resting potential 70-80mV lower** than extracellular fluid

##Ion Permeability
At rest, the cell is:
* Permeable to **potassium**
    * Potassium flows out down its concentration gradient  
    This makes the resting potential becomes more negative.
        * This negative charge opposes the further movement of potassium and so an equilibrium is established between opposing electrical and chemical gradients
* Impermeable to other cations  
The membrane is not perfectly impermeable to sodium, and Na<sup>+</sup> will leak in down its concentration gradient.
    * The 3Na<sup>+</sup>-2K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pumps **three sodium ions** outside in exchange for **two potassium ions** in order to maintain these gradients  
    As there is an unequal exchange of charge, this pump is **electrogenic**.

| Ion | [Intracellular] | [Extracellular] | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Na<sup>+</sup> | 15 | 140 |
| K<sup>+</sup> | 150 | 4.5 |
| Cl<sup>-</sup> | 10 | 100 |
