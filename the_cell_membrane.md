#The Cell Membrane {#id}
> Describe the cell membrane and cellular organelles and their properties.

Cell membranes are formed by a **phospholipid bilayer** which separates intracellular and extracellular contents. The membrane is **semi-permeable**, which leads to different ionic concentrations (and therefore electrical charge) on either side of the membrane. The alteration in charge means the membrane acts as a **capacitor**, with most cells having a **resting potential 70-80mV lower** than extracellular fluid.

##Ion Permeability
At rest, the cell is:
* Permeable to **potassium**
* Impermeable to other cations

As the membrane is permeable to potassium, it flows out against its concentration gradient. As this occurs the resting potential becomes more negative. This negative charge opposes the further movement of potassium and so an equilibrium between opposing electrical and chemical gradients.

The membrane is not perfectly impermeable to sodium, and so a Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump transports **three sodium ions** outside in exchange for **two potassium ions** in order to maintain these gradients. As there is an unequal exchange of charge, this pump is **electrogenic**.

| Ion | [Intracellular] | [Extracellular] | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Na<sup>+</sup> | 15 | 140 |
| K<sup>+</sup> | 150 | 4.5 |
| Cl<sup>-</sup> | 10 | 100 |
