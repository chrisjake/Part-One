#Circle System

The circle breathing system is a highly efficient system which:
* Requires **rebreathing** of expired gases  
    * CO<sub>2</sub> is actively removed
    * Rebreathing of anaesthetic gases makes volatile anaesthesia cost-effective
    * Rebreathing of medical gases is important in resource-limited settings (e.g. prehospital to reduce oxygen consumption)
* Is a closed-circuit system
    * The only gases which must be replaced are those:
        * Consumed by the patient
            * Oxygen
            * Absorbed and metabolised volatile agents
        * Lost via leak
        

##Principles
A circle circuit consists of:
* A y-piece, connecting the circuit to the patient
* Expiratory and inspiratory valves, ensuring unidirectional flow
* A means of generating pressure  
In most systems this consists of both a ventilator and a resevoir bag with APL valve attached, with a bag/vent switch to swap between circuits.
    * These are typically placed on the expiratory limb so that gas can be removed via scavenging prior to passage through soda lime  
    This reduces soda lime consumption, as some CO<sub>2</sub> will be scavenged.
* Soda lime  
To absorb CO<sub>2</sub>.
* Fresh gas flow  
    * Includes oxygen, air and nitrous oxide
    * Oxygen enters the back-bar last
    * When the vapouriser is out-of-circuit, all fresh gas flow will pass through the vapouriser prior to entering the circle
* A separate high-pressure high-flow oxygen flush, which bypasses the vapouriser

###Pros
* Cheaper to operate
* Conserves gases, heat, and moisture
* Low dead space
* Reduced greenhouse effects


###Cons
* Gas mixture settings are not delivered to the patient  
Settings affect the fresh gas flow mixture, whilst the patient respires gas from the circuit. These are not identical, especially at low flows.
* Nitrogen may build up in the circuit during low-flow anaesthesia, and potentially lead to delivery of a hypoxic gas mixture
* Less portable than open-circuit systems
* Increased circuit resistance
* Requires soda lime, which can be toxic
    * Produces compound A from sevoflurane
    * Produces carbon monoxide from desflurane and isoflurane/enflurane
    * Dangerous if aspirated
