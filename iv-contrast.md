##Intravenous Contrast {id}

Intravenous contrast may be divided into:
* **X-ray Contrast**  
These agents are all based on a tri-iodinated benzene ring, which absorbs x-ray radiation. Alterations to this ring alter toxicity, lipophilicity, and elimination.
    * Agents are classified by these structural differences into:
        * Ionic  
    Ionic substances are strong acids and are water soluble due to ionisation. They are further divided into:
            * Monomers  
        Typically high molecular weight.
            * Dimers
        * Non-Ionic  
        Water soluble due to hydrophilic side chains. Lower molecular weight than ionic contrast agents.
            * Monomer  
            Agent of choice for angiography.
                * Easy to inject
                * Water soluble at physiologic pH
            * Dimer  
            Harder to inject than monomers due to higher viscosity. Typically used for urography.
    * All are renally eliminated, and may be retained in renal dysfunction
* **Gadolinium Contrast**  
Gd<sup>3+</sup>, due to its seven unpaired electrons, is paramagetic and will alters the magnetic field of an MRI machine.
    * Free gadolinium is nephrotoxic and must be chelated
    * This increases its solubility and allows it to be renally eliminated
    * Gadolinuim also attenuates x-rays, but is not used as x-ray contrast as doses required would be toxic
    
##Adverse Reactions
Adverse reactions to low-osmolarity agents are uncommon (3%), with severe reactions being very rare (0.04%) and fatal reactions being extremely rare (1:170,000).

###General Adverse Reactions
Adverse ractions include:
* Chemotoxicity
    * Platelet inhibition
    * Increased vagal tone
        * Negative inotropy
        * Negative chromotropy
* Ionic toxicity
    * Cellular membrane dysfunction  
    May worsen myasthenia gravis.
* Osmotoxicity
    * Pain
    * Emesis
    * Increased PAP
    * Decreased PVR
* Hypersensitivity reaction  
Typically occur within 20 minutes of injection.
    
Risk factors include:
* Asthma or atopy
* Critically ill
* Cardiac disease
* Renal disease

###Contrast Nephropathy
Defined as an increase in creatinine by 25% above baseline within three days of IV contrast administration.
    * It is theorised that osmotic stress and direct tubular toxic effects lead to renal tubular injury, and may cause acute tubular necrosis
    * Typically is benign, with creatinine returning to baseline within 10-14 days
    * Rehydration and volume correction are effective in preventing a rise in creatinine
