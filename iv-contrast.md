##Intravenous Contrast {id}

Intravenous contrast may be divided into:
* **X-ray Contrast**  
These agents are all based on a tri-iodinated benzene ring, which absorbs x-ray radiation. Alterations to this ring alter toxicity, lipophilicity, and elimination.
    * Agents are classified by these structural differences into:
        * Ionic  
    Ionic substances are strong acids and are water soluble due to ionisation. They are further divided into:
            * Monomers  
        Typically high molecular weight.
            * Dimers
        * Non-Ionic  
        Water soluble due to hydrophilic side chains. Lower molecular weight than ionic contrast agents.
            * Monomer  
            Agent of choice for angiography.
                * Easy to inject
                * Water soluble at physiologic pH
            * Dimer  
            Harder to inject than monomers due to higher viscosity. Typically used for urography.
    * All are renally eliminated, and may be retained in renal dysfunction
* **Gadolinium Contrast**  
Gd<sup>3+</sup>, due to its seven unpaired electrons, is paramagetic and will alters the magnetic field of an MRI machine.
    * Free gadolinium is nephrotoxic and must be chelated
    * This increases its solubility and allows it to be renally eliminated
