##Intravenous Contrast {id}

Intravenous contrast may be divided into:
* **X-ray Contrast**  
These agents are all based on a tri-iodinated benzene ring, which absorbs x-ray radiation. Alterations to this ring alter toxicity, lipophilicity, and elimination. Agents are classified by these structural differences into:
    * Ionic Monomers
    * Ionic Dimers
    * Non-Ionic Monomers
    * Non-Ionic Dimers
