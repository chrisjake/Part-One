#Intraocular Pressure

Normal intraocular pressure is ~**15mmHg**, with a range of 12-20mmHg. Regulation of intraocular pressure is important for:
* Vision  
Sustained high (>25mmHg) can lead to blindness due to compression of axons of the optic nerve and the optic artery at the optic disc.

##Determinants of Intraocular Pressure
As the globe has typically poor compliance, a small increase in volume can cause a large increase in intraocular pressure. Factors affecting volume include:
* Volume of aqueous humor  
Aqueous humor is a clear fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye, and provides avascular tissues with nutrients and oxygen whilst still allowing light to pass freely between the lens and retina. Volume of aqueous humor is a function of:
    * Production  
    Aqueous humor is produced by secretion and filtration from capillaries in the ciliary body in the posterior chamber, and circulates through into the anterior chamber.
        * Production is accelerated by β2<sub>2</sub> agonism
        * Production is inhibited by α<sub>2</sub> agonism
        * Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease aqueous humor production probably by decreasing sodium secretion into the eye
    * Reabsorption  
    Aqueous humor is reabsorbed into venous blood in the **canal of Schlemm**.
        * The **trabeculae meshwork** is the main source of resistance to reabsorption  
        If this is blocked, a significant reduction in reabsorption can occur and IOP will increase.
        * Reabsorption is affected by:
            * Haemorrhage  
            Blocks trabecular meshwork.
            * Muscarinic antagonism  
            Dilates pupil, which brings the iris closer to canal and decreases absorption.
            * α<sub>1</sub> agonism  
            Dilates the pupil, decreasing absorption.
            * PGF<sub>2α</sub>  
            Relaxes ciliary muscle, increasing absorption.
    
                    
* Volume of blood within the globe  
Affected by:
    * MAP 
    * Venous obstruction
    
    
* External factors
Other factors affecting volume or compliance of the globe:
    * Extraocular muscle tension
    * Extraocular compression
