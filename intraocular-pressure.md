#Intraocular Pressure

Normal intraocular pressure is ~**15mmHg**, with a range of 12-20mmHg. Regulation of intraocular pressure is important for:
* Vision  
Sustained high (>25mmHg) can lead to blindness due to compression of axons of the optic nerve and the optic artery at the optic disc.

##Control of Intraocular Pressure
Intraocular pressure is a function of:
* Volume of aqueous humour  
This is a function of:
    * Production  
    Aqueous humour is produced in the ciliary body.
    * Reabsorption  
    Aqueous humour is reabsorbed in the **canal of Schlemm**.
        * The **trabeculae meshwork** is the main source of resistance to reabsorption  
        If this is blocked (e.g. following haemorrhage), a significant reduction in reabsorption can occur and IOP will increas.e
* Volume of blood within the globe
* External fctors

As the globe has typically poor compliance, a small increase in volume can cause a large increase in intraocular pressure.
