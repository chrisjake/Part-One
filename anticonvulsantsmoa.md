# Anticonvulsants
> An understanding of the pharmacology of ~~anti-depressant, anti-psychotic,~~ anti-convulsant~~, and anti-Parkinsonian~~ medication

Anticonvulsants work via a number of different mechanisms.

##Sodium Channel Blockers
These drugs stabilise the inactive state of the channel, preventing return to the active state which prevents generation of further action potentials. This prevents post-tetanic potentiation and limits the development of seizure activity. These drugs may also have Class I antiarrhythmic properties, as a consequence of their Na<sup>+</sup> blocking effect.

Sodium channel blockers include: phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine.

##GABA Mediators
GABA is the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. GABA mediators work in some way to increase the effect of GABA, either as direct GABA-receptor agonists (benzodiazepines and phenobarbital), GABA reuptake inhibition (Tiagabine), or as GABA transaminase inhibitors (vigabatrin).

Sodium Valproate may increase GABA synthesis.

##Glutamate Blockers
Glutamate is an important CNS excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate antagonists have little use in practice due to the side effect profile, which includes psychosis and hallucinations. Glutamate blockers include topiramate.

##Other Agents
Ironically gabapentin and pregabalin do not appear to mediate GABA, but they do have anticonvulsant properties via their inhibition of excitatory voltage-gated calcium channels.
