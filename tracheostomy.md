# Tracheostomy
> Describe the anatomy relevant to the performance of a ~~naso, or endo, tracheal intubation, a cricothyroidotomy or~~ tracheostomy

##Trachea
A fibrocatilagenous tube which extends from the larynx superiorly to the Plane of Louis inferiorly, where it divides into the right and left mainstem bronchi. It runs at 15 degrees paralell to the surface of the neck, such that the distal trachea is deeper than the proximal trachea. It has a D-shaped cross section, with 18-22 incomplete cartilaginous rings anteriorly which maintain tracheal patency. The posterior wall of the trachea is spanned by longitudinal smooth muscle known as trachealis.

The trachea is typically **10cm long**, **2.3cm wide**, and **1.8cm in AP diameter**.

###Relationships
Lateral to the trachea are the carotid sheaths, containing the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagal nerves. Other stuctures include the thyroid lobes (and inferior thyroid arteries), and the recurrent laryngeal nerves.

Inferior to the isthmus include the thyroid veins.

Posterior to the tracheal include the oesophagus and vertebral column.

##Surface Anatomy
Midline neck structures are relevant surface anatomy:
* Layngeal structures, including: Hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricothyroid membrane, cricoid cartilage
* Sternal notch
* Thyroid lobes (lateral to trachea)

##Layers of Dissection
* Skin
* Subcutaneous fat
* Superficial and Deep Pretracheal fascia
* Tracheal wall
    * Ideally between 1st and 2nd rings
