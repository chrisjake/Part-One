# The Viva

The viva is the part of the exam most candidates seem to be more stressed about. However:
* If you make it to the written, you will most likely pass  
Very few people succeed in the written exams to fail at the viva.
    * The knowledge is there
    * Examiners want you to pass  
    They will redirect you if you're off track.
        * This makes it easier to make up marks than on the written, where you can easily go off down the rabbit hole, haemorrhaging time and marks.
