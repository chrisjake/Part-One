# The Viva

The viva is the part of the exam most candidates seem to be more stressed about. However:
* If you make it to the written, you will most likely pass  
Very few people succeed in the written exams to fail at the viva.
    * The knowledge is there
    * Examiners want you to pass  
    They will redirect you if you're off track.
        * This makes it easier to make up marks than on the written, where you can easily go off down the rabbit hole, haemorrhaging time and marks.

However, you still need to prepare appropriately. To do well at the viva:
* Understand the viva is a performance piece  
The viva is a ritualised converation. Doing well requires you to know and understand the language and structure used, just like the SAQ.
* Structure your answer  
As with the SAQ, categorise your answer.
    * Have a good opening statement
    Don't answer more than is asked.
    * Start broad  
    Often the viva will go into depth on only one or two areas of a topic. If you start going into detail on only parts of a topic, it makes it hard for the examiner to redirect you and scores you no marks.
* Be confident  
Enjoy it if you can.
* Learn to think on your feet  
The viva will often assess knowledge in a different way to the SAQs. The knowledge will still be there, but may require a different approach to access it. This requires **practice**. This is also important for deliver a sound answer based on incomplete knowledge.
* It's okay to say "I don't know"  
But probably not on the first question.
    * If you don't know immmediately, can you work it out from first principles?  
* Don't get angry  
    * With yourself
    * With the examiner  
    Don't argue.
* Don't apologise  
Apologies:
    * Make you lose confidence
    * Don't get you marks  
    Remember, marks per unit-time.
* Don't talk over the examiner  
They are interrupting you because what you are saying is gaining no marks. If you keep talking, you will:
    * Irritate them
    * Not get marks
