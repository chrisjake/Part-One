# Antidepressants

*Symptoms and management of TCA overdose is covered under [Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose](tricyclic_antidepressant_overdose.md).*

Antidepressant drugs include:
* Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)  
Mechanism of action by multiple effects, including:
  * Competitively inhibit reuptake of NA and 5-HT
  * Muscarinic antagonism  
  Leads to anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention).
  * H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> antagonism
  * α<sub>1</sub> antagonism
  * NMDA antagonism
* Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
  * Inhibit neural reuptake of 5-HT
  * Preferred over TCAs as:
    * Similar effectiveness
    * Better side effect profile
    

|Property|Amitriptyline|Fluoxetine|
|--|--|
|**Class**|TCA|SSRI|
|**Uses**|Depression, treatment of chronic pain and trigeminal neuralgia|Depression, anxiety|
|**Absorption**|High PO bioavailability|High PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|Highly lipid soluble with High V<sub>D</sub>. Very highly protein bound - leads to interactions with warfarin, digoxin, and aspirin|Highly protein bound, high V<sub>D</sub>
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic with active metabolites. Large interpatient variability|Hepatic with non-linear kinetics
|**Elimination**||Unaffected by renal impairment
|**Resp**|Dry mouth
|**CVS**|Postural hypotension, ↑ HR.<br>QT prolongation and widening QRS in overdose, with arrhythmia more likely when QRS exceeds 0.16s.|Less cardiotoxic than TCAs, may precipite serotonin syndrome
|**CNS**|Sedation, blurred vision, lowered seizure threshold. Excitation, followed by seizures and depression in overdose.|Identical antidepressant effect to TCAs. Less sedation
|**Renal**|Urinary retention||
|**GU**|Sexual dysfunction|Greater incidence of sexual dysfunction compared with TCAs
|**GIT**|Constipation|Greater incidence of N/V compared with TCAs
|**Other**|Multiple compex drug interactions, including arrhythmias and variable BP with sympathomimetics, central anticholinergic syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and seizures.






##Serotonin Syndrome
Serotonin syndrome is excessive serotonin in the CNS, typically as a consequence of drug interactions. The syndrome may be mild, moderate, or severe, and presents with some or all of:
* Altered mental state
  * Confusion
* Motor changes
  * Myoclonus
  * Hyperreflexia
  * Tremor
* Autonomic instability
  * Diaphoresis
  * Shivering
  * Fever

Serotonin syndrome is typically self-limiting and resolves with cessation of the drug.
