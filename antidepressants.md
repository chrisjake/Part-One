# Antidepressants
Antidepressant drugs include:
* Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)  
Mechanism of action by multiple effects, including:
  * Inhibit reuptake of NA and 5-HT
  * Muscarinic antagonism  
  Leads to anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention).
  * H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> antagonism
  * α<sub>1</sub> antagonism
  * NMDA antagonism
* Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
  * Inhibit neural reuptake of 5-Ht
  * Preferred over TCAs as:
    * Similar effectiveness
    * Better side effect profile

##Serotonin Syndrome
Serotonin syndrome is excessive serotonin in the CNS, typically as a consequence of drug interactions. The syndrome may be mild, moderate, or severe, and presents with some or all of:
* Altered mental state
  * Confusion
* Motor changes
  * Myoclonus
  * Hyperreflexia
  * Tremor
* Autonomic instability
  * Diaphoresis
  * Shivering
  * Fever

Serotonin syndrome is typically self-limiting and resolvs with cessation of the drug.
