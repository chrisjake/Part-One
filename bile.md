# Bile
> Describe the physiology of bile and its metabolism

Bile is a dark green solution produced by the liver to facilitate absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (ADEK) through emulsification. It consists of water, protein, bilirbuin, bile salts, lipids, and electrolytes.

Approximately 1L is produced by the liver per day. It is stored in the gallbladder, which contracts and empties prior to a meal.

##Bilirubin Metabolism
1. **Haemoglobin** is metabolised **to biliverdin** by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system of the **spleen**
    * Circulating erythrocytes are phagocytosed by splenic macrophages
    * Haptoglobin binds circulating Hb, the Hb-Haptoglobin complex is then phagocytosed by splenic macrophages
* **Biliverdin** is reduced **to unconjugated bilirubin**. This is fat soluble, and is bound to albumin.
* **Unconjugated bilirubin** is conjugated in the liver to **conjugated bilirubin**
* **Conjugated bilirubin** is **secreted in bile** by active transport. This is impaired during hepatic disease, leading to increased bilirubin levels in plasma.
* Secreted **conjugated bilirubin** is metabolised **to urobilinogen** by gut bacteria
* **Urobilinogen** may have a number of fates:
    * Enterohepatic recirculation and elimination in bile (again)
    * Further metabolism by gut bacteria to **stercobilinogen** and then to **sterobilin**
    * Enterohepatic recirculation and urinary excretion, where it is oxidised to **urobilin**

###In Disease
||Blood|Urine|Faeces|
|--|--|--|
|**Prehepatic disease**|↑ Unconjugated bilirubin| ↑ Urobilinogen, bilirubin not present|Normal|
|**Intrahepatic disease**|↑ Conjugated bilirubin, ↑ Unconjugated bilirubin| Bilirubin present|May be pale due to decreased urobilinogen excreted in bile|
|**Posthepatic disease**|↑ Conjugated bilirubin|↓ Urobilinogen, bilirubin present|Pale|
