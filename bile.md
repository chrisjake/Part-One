> Describe the physiology of bile and its metabolism

Bile is a dark green solution produced by the liver to facilitate absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (ADEK) through emulsification. It consists of water, protein, bilirbuin, bile salts, lipids, and electrolytes.

Approximately 1L is produced by the liver per day. It is stored in the gallbladder, which contracts and empties prior to a meal.
