# Sleep
> Describe the physiology of sleep

Sleep is a naturally occuring state of unconsciousness from which one can be aroused by an external stimuli. It is important in homeostasis of many components of brain activity, as well as other organ systems.

It can be broadly split into two types:
* **Slow-wave sleep**  
Deep sleep, characterised by depression of HR, SVR, BP, RR, and metabolic rate (~0.9 METs) It is divided into four stages on EEG:
    * Stage 1: 4-6Hz θwaves replace α-waves
    * Stage 2: Occasional high frequency 50μV bursts
    * Stage 3: 1-2Hz high-voltage δ waves
    * Stage 4: Large δ waves become synchronised


* **REM sleep**  
Characterised by EEG activity resembling that of awake individuals. REM sleep lasts for 5-30 minutes, with event frequency decreasing with age. In REM sleep:
    * Dreaming occurs
    * Irregular HR and RR
    * Muscle contraction occurs (but muscle tone is decreased)
