> Describe the physiology of sleep

Sleep is a naturally occuring state of unconsciousness from which one can be aroused by an external stimuli.

Sleep is important in:
* Homeostasis of many organ systems
* Memory formation
* Preservation of cognitive function

##Stages of Sleep
Stages of sleep are classified based on EEG changes:
* **REM sleep**  
Characterised by EEG activity resembling that of awake individuals. REM sleep:
    * Lasts for 5-30 minutes  
    Event frequency decreases with age.
    * In REM sleep:
        * Irregular eye movements
        * Dreaming occurs
        * Irregular HR and RR
        * Muscle contraction occurs (but muscle tone is decreased)


* **Non-REM sleep**  
Deep sleep, characterised by depression of HR, SVR, BP, RR, and metabolic rate (~0.9 METs) It is divided into four stages on EEG:
    * Stage 1: 4-6Hz θ waves replace α-waves  
    Dosing, easily roused.
    * Stage 2: Similar to stage 1 with occasional high frequency 50μV bursts (sleep spindles)
    * Stage 3: 1-2Hz high-voltage δ waves appear
    * Stage 4: Large δ waves become synchronised  
    Deep sleep.

Periods of REM sleep alternate with non-REM sleep during the night, with an average of 4-5 cycles of REM slep per night.

##Respiratory Effects
GABAergic neurons depress the respiratory centre, causing:
* Decreased MV
    * Decreased V<sub>T</sub>
    * Unchanged RR
* Increased PaCO<sub>2</sub>
* Decreased PO<sub>2</sub>  
More pronounced in elderly.


* Collapse of airway soft tissue  
Due to reduced tonic activity of pharyngeal muscles.
