##Medical Gas Cylinders

#Vacuum Insulated Evaporator
The VIE:
* Stores **liquid oxygen**  
It is **vacuum insulated** as it must keep oxygen below its critical temperature (-119°C). The VIE typically stores oxygen between -160°C and -180°C.
    * The amount of oxygen remaining can therefore be calculated from its mass
* Does not require active cooling  
Instead it is cooled by:
    * Insulation
    * Evaporation  
    Heat entering the VIE causes liquid oxygen to evaporate. Oxygen vapour is drawn off the VIE to the pipeline supply, so the VIE remains cool and at a steady pressure provided oxygen is being drawn from it.
* Has a pressure relief valve to prevent explosions if oxygen is not being used
* Has an evaporator to evaporate large volumes of oxygen rapidly if demand is high
    * This is simply an uninsulated pipe exposed to the outside temperature


##Pros
* Cheapest option for oxygen delivery and storage
    * Storing oxygen as a liquid is much more efficient than as a gas
    * Does not require power

##Cons
* Set-up costs are expensive
* Requires a back-up setup
* Will waste large volumes of oxygen if not being used continuously
* Fire risk
