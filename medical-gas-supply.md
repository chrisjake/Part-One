#Medical Gas Supply

> <p style="color:purple";>Describe the supply of medical gases (bulk supply and cylinder) and features to ensure supply safety including pressure valves and regulators and connection systems</p>

##Production

###Oxygen Concentrator
Oxygen concentrators:
* Produce up to 95% oxygen from air by removing nitrogen
* Built using two **zeolite lattices**
    * Pressurised air is filtered through one lattice
        * Nitrogen and water vapour are retained in the lattice
        * Oxygen and **argon** are concentrated  
        Produces a 95% oxygen/5% argon mixture.
    * The unused column is heated to release the bound nitrogen and water

####Pros
* Cheap
* Reliable
* Avoid need for oxygen deliery

####Cons
* Result in an accumulation of argon when used at low flows on a circle system
* Require continuous power
* Fire and explosion risk



##Storage
###Medical Gas Cylinders
Gas cylinders are:
* Made from chromium molybdenum or aluminium
* Used as:
    * Backup for a piped supply
    * When a piped supply is not available (transports)
    * When the gas is uncommonly used (e.g. nitric)


* The common cylinder used in hospital is **CD**  
This contains **460 L** of oxygen at 15째C and 137 bar.

* Cylinders are not completely filled, to reduce risk of overpressure and explosions if the temperature rises
    * The **filling ratio** is the weight of liquid in a full cylinder compared to the weight of water that would completely fill the cylinder
        * In cool climates, the filling ratio is ~0.75
        * In warmer climates, the filling ratio is reduced to ~0.67

* Cylinders are tested for safety every 5-10 years  
Tests include:
    * Endoscopic examination
    * Tensile tests  
    1% of cylinders are destroyed to perform testing on the metal.

####Pros
* Portable
* Reusable

####Cons
* Heavy
* Limited supply

###Cylinder Manifolds
Cylinder manifolds are formed of sets of large gas cylinders used in parallel.
* All cylinders in a group are used together
* When the pressure falls below a level, a valve will start drawing gas from another cylinder group

####Pros
* Cheap
* Useful as a backup supply

####Cons
* Less capacity than a VIE
* Fire and explosion risk

###Vacuum Insulated Evaporator
The VIE:
* Stores **liquid oxygen**  
It is **vacuum insulated** as it must keep oxygen below its critical temperature (-119째C). The VIE typically stores oxygen between -160째C and -180째C.
    * The amount of oxygen remaining can therefore be calculated from its mass
* Does not require active cooling  
Instead it is cooled by:
    * Insulation
    * Evaporation  
    Heat entering the VIE causes liquid oxygen to evaporate. Oxygen vapour is drawn off the VIE to the pipeline supply, so the VIE remains cool and at a steady pressure provided oxygen is being drawn from it.
* Has a pressure relief valve to prevent explosions if oxygen is not being used
* Has an evaporator to evaporate large volumes of oxygen rapidly if demand is high
    * This is simply an uninsulated pipe exposed to the outside temperature


####Pros
* Cheapest option for oxygen delivery and storage
    * Storing oxygen as a liquid is much more efficient than as a gas
    * Does not require power

####Cons
* Set-up costs are expensive
* Requires a back-up setup
* Will waste large volumes of oxygen if not being used continuously
* Fire and explosion risk

##Safety in Medical Gas Supply
Many systems exist to ensure safety:
* Colour coding of cylinders and hoses
    * Oxygen is white
    * Air is black
    * Nitrous oxide is blue
* Labelling of connections
* The **pin index system**  
Used to prevent the wrong gas yoke being connected to a cylinder
    * Pins protrude from the back of the yoke
    * Holes exist on the valve block
    * Pins and holes must line up for the cylinder to be connected
    * There are six positions, divided into two groups of three  
    Common combinations include:
        * Oxygen: 2-5
        * Air: 1-5
        * Nitrous oxide: 3-5
* **Non-Interchangeable Screw Thread** (NIST)  
Used when connecting pipeline gases.
    * NIST connectors have a probe and a nut
    * Probe diameter is gas-specific, preventing the wrong gas from being connected
