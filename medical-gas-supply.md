#Medical Gas Supply

> <p style="color:purple";>Describe the supply of medical gases (bulk supply and cylinder) and features to ensure supply safety including pressure valves and regulators and connection systems</p>

##Medical Gas Cylinders
Gas cylinders are:
* Made from chromium molybdenum or aluminium
* Used as:
    * Backup for a piped supply
    * When a piped supply is not available (transports)
    * When the gas is uncommonly used (e.g. nitric)


* The common cylinder used in hospital is **CD**  
This contains **460 L** of oxygen at 15째C and 137 bar.

###Pros
* Portable
* Reusable

###Cons
* Heavy
* Limited supply

##Cylinder Manifolds
Cylinder manifolds are formed of sets of large gas cylinders used in parallel.
* All cylinders in a group are used together
* When the pressure falls below a level, a valve will start drawing gas from another cylinder group

###Pros
* Cheap
* Useful as a backup supply

###Cons
* Less capacity than a VIE
* Fire and explosion risk

##Vacuum Insulated Evaporator
The VIE:
* Stores **liquid oxygen**  
It is **vacuum insulated** as it must keep oxygen below its critical temperature (-119째C). The VIE typically stores oxygen between -160째C and -180째C.
    * The amount of oxygen remaining can therefore be calculated from its mass
* Does not require active cooling  
Instead it is cooled by:
    * Insulation
    * Evaporation  
    Heat entering the VIE causes liquid oxygen to evaporate. Oxygen vapour is drawn off the VIE to the pipeline supply, so the VIE remains cool and at a steady pressure provided oxygen is being drawn from it.
* Has a pressure relief valve to prevent explosions if oxygen is not being used
* Has an evaporator to evaporate large volumes of oxygen rapidly if demand is high
    * This is simply an uninsulated pipe exposed to the outside temperature


###Pros
* Cheapest option for oxygen delivery and storage
    * Storing oxygen as a liquid is much more efficient than as a gas
    * Does not require power

###Cons
* Set-up costs are expensive
* Requires a back-up setup
* Will waste large volumes of oxygen if not being used continuously
* Fire and explosion risk

##Oxygen Concentrator
Oxygen concentrators:
* Produce up to 95% oxygen from air by removing nitrogen
* Built using two **zeolite lattices**
    * Pressurised air is filtered through one lattice
        * Nitrogen and water vapour are retained in the lattice
        * Oxygen and argon are concentrated  
        Produces a 95% oxygen/5% argon mixture.
