#Sample Size Calculation
> Describe bias, types of error, confounding factors and **sample size calculations, and the factors that influence them**

##Samples
A sample is a subset of a population that we wish to investigate. We take measurements on our sample with the aim to make inferences on the general population. An optimal sample (in quantitative research) will be **representative**, that is, it has the same characteristics of the population it is drawn from.

###Sampling error
Due to chance, the sample mean will not equal the population mean. This is called **sampling error**, and is a form of random error. A larger sample will more closely approximate the population mean, reducing random error leading to more accurate point estimates and narrower confidence intervals. 

This is why large sample sizes are desirable in research. However, larger studies are also more costly and time consuming to run. Sample-size calculations are performed to find a happy medium.

##Sample size calculation
All sample size calculations depend on **four** things:
* Acceptable **risk of Type I error (α)**, typically set at 0.05  
  A **smaller α** (lower false positive risk) requires a larger sample size
* Acceptable **risk of Type II error (β)**, typically set at 0.20  
  A **smaller β** (lower false negative risk) requires a larger sample size
* Expected **effect size**  
  A **smaller effect size** requires a larger sample size, as the difference between groups will be smaller and harder to detect
* Population **variance**  
  A **larger population variance** requires a larger sample size, as there is more 'noise' in the sample

Different formulas for sample size calculations exist for different studies, and can be adjusted for particular study designs, such as multiple or unequal groups.
