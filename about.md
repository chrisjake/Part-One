# Part One

These are my notes for basic sciences exam for the CICM. They provided free of charge, and so without guarantees of accuracy, currency, or correct spelling and use of grammar.

They have been put together more or less as per the structure laid out in the curriculum. Because CICM doubled-down on a lot of the pharmacology, the physiology bits of pharm (e.g. the receptors, and their effects) are covered in detail in the relevant physiology section, whilst the drugs (and their effects and any idiosyncrasies) are covered in the pharmacopeia.

##Technical Credits
Part 1 was built on the back of a number of open-source and free tools. Thanks and credit goes to:
* John Gruber for Markdown, and his [excellent documentation over at Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
* The [LaTeX project](https://www.latex-project.org/), for a delightfully intuitive mathematics markup language.
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for making pretty XKCD-style graphs easy and sparing everyone my truly awful drawings.
* [haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) for making an excellent free text editor that plays nicely with both markdown and LaTeX.
* The team at [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) for making such a slick and beautiful  publishing tool. Using it was a dream.
