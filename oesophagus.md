#Oesophagus
> Describe the control of gastrointestinal motility, including sphincter function.

The oesophagus is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach. The oesophagus:
* Has **skeletal muscle** in its **upper third**, and **smooth muscle** in its **lower third**

##Lower Oesophageal Sphincter
The LoS is:
* The most distal **2-4cm** of the oesophagus
* Macroscopically indistinguishable from the rest of the oesophagus
    * However it has a higher concentration of nerve cells and is able to constrict at a higher pressure
* Tonically innervated by the vagus
* Important in the prevention of reflux  
Competency of the LoS is required to prevent reflux
    * **Barrier pressure is** the pressure difference between the pressure at the lower oesophageal sphincter and the pressure in the stomach, and is typically **~20mmHg**  
    Barrier pressure is affected by:
        * Changes in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure
            * Age
            Sphincter tone is decreased in neonates and the elderly.
            * Swallowing
            Barrier pressure decreases during swallowing.
            * Diaphgram  
            An external sphincter is formed by diaphragmatic fibres, and exerts a **pinch-cock** action on the oesophagus.
            * Stomach  
            A fold in the stomach wall just distal to the GOJ creates a **flap valve**, which occludes the GOJ when gastric pressure rises.
        * Changes in gastric pressure
            * Raised intraabdominal pressure
                * Obesity
                * Pregnancy
