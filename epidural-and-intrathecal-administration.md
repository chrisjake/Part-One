#Epidural and Intrathecal
> Describe the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the epidural and subarachnoid space

In both spaces, speed of onset is affected by Fick's Law.

##Epidural Space
Factors important to epidural administration:
* Dose given
* Volume given  
Increased volume increases area of subarachnoid that the drug is in contact with, increasing rate of diffusion.
* Solubility  
Affected by:
    * pKa and pH  
    Determines unionised portion available to cross into CSF.
    * Protein binding  
    Determines free drug portion able to cross into CSF.
    * Lipid solubility
* CSF flow  
Alters concentration gradient between epidural and subarachnoid space.
