#Alterations to Drug Response
>Define tachyphylaxis, tolerance, addiction, dependence and idiosyncrasy

There are four mechanisms which result in variable response to drug:
* Alteration in drug that reaches the receptor  
  This is typically due to pharmacokinetic factors.
* Relative difference in presence of exogenous and endogenous ligands
  Antagonists will have a greater effect in the presence of high endogenous ligand concentration.
* Variation in receptor function and number
  Up-regulation and down-regulation of receptors may occur as a consequence of prolonged stimulus.
* Alteration in function distal to the receptor

##Key Terms
* **Tachyphylaxis** is the **rapid decrease in response** to repeated dosing over a **short time period**, usually due to depletion of transmitter.

* **Desensitisation** is the **loss in response** over a **long time period**, usually due to change in receptor morphology or loss in receptor numbers. 

* **Withdrawal** is a pathological response when a drug is ceased. During administration receptors may be **up-regulated** in the continued presence of an antagonist, or **down-regulated** in the continued presence of an agonist. Loss of receptor numbers may precipitate withdrawal when the agonist or antagonist is ceased.

* **Addiction** is a behavioural pattern characterised by compulsive use and fixation on acquiring and using a drug.

* **Idiosyncrasy** is an individual patient response to a drug. It is typically mediated by a reactive metabolite rather than the drug itself.

###Tolerance
**Tolerance** is the requirement for a **larger dose** to achieve the **same effect**, due to altered sensitivity of the receptors to the stimulant. Proposed mechanisms include:
* **Change in receptor morphology**  
Can occur with ion-channel receptors and GPCRs:  
    * Ion-channel receptors bind the ligand but do not open the channel
    * GPCR become 'uncoupled' - phosphorylation of the receptor makes it unable to activate second messenger cascade, though it can still bind the ligand.


* **Receptor down-regulation**  
Prolonged exposure to agonists causes transmembrane (typically hormone) receptors to become **internalised**. This occurs more slowly than uncoupling.

* **Receptor up-regulation**  
Prolonged exposure to antagonists causes an upregulation of receptor.
    * Can lead to rebound effects when a drug is ceased (e.g. hypertension with cessation of clonidine)

* **Exhaustation of mediators**  
Similar to tachyphylaxis - depletion of a mediating substance decreases the effect.


* **Altered drug metabolism**  
Metabolism may be **increased or decreased**:  
    * Enzymatic induction and increased drug metabolism
    Increased hepatic enzyme pathway capacity increases metabolism and lowers plasma concentration.
    * Decreased metabolism  
    Decreased metabolism of a drug can result in a reduced effect.


* **Physiological adapation**  
Actions of a drug may be countered by a compensatory homeostatic response.

* **Active removal of the drug from the cell**

##Alterations in Drug Response: Patient Factors
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are affected in pregnancy and at extremes of age.

###Pregnancy
* Absorption
    * Decreased gastric emptying
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Increased cardiac output
        * Increases IM and SC absorption
    * Volatiles:
        * Increased onset due to increased MV and reduced FRC
        * Decreased onset due to increased CO
* Distribution
    * Increased V<sub>D</sub> due to:
        * Increased TBW
        * Increased plasma volume
        * Increased fat mass
    * Decreased albumin and α<sub>1</sub>-glycoprotein
* Metabolism
    * No change to HBF
    * Progesterone induces enzymes
    * Oestrogen competes for enzymes
    * Decreased plasma cholinesterase activity
* Elimination
    * Increased RBF
    * Increased GFR
    
* Pharmacodynamic
    * Decreased MAC
    * Increased LA sensitivity due to decreased α<sub>1</sub>-glycoprotein

####Foetus
Drugs that cross the placenta can be teratogenic to the foetus, besides to exerting their usual pharmacological effects.

**Pharmacokinetic** factors predominantly **affect placental transfer**, and include:
* **Lipid solubility**  
Lipid soluble drugs diffuse more rapidly.
* **Molecular size**  
Drugs with a molecular weight >1000 dalton cross the placenta slowly.
* **Protein binding**
* **Placental transporters**  
Some medications are actively removed from foetal circulation.
* **Placental metabolism**  
The placenta can metabolise some medications, although in some cases results in toxic metabolites.

Maternal **pharmacodynamic** factors predominantly affect the uterus and breast, but **major organ systems** are **not significantly affected**.

Drugs that cross the placenta can have dramatic effects in the foetus. These include:
* **Teratogenesis** - a drug which adversely affects foetal development causing a permanent abnormality. Multifactorial mechanisms that are not well understood.


###Neonates
At < 1 year of age, pharmacokinetics are significantly altered:
* **Absorption**  
  * Delayed gastric emptying, increasing absorption of drugs metabolised in the stomach.
  * Decreased secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile salts impairs absorption of lipid soluble medications
  * Smaller muscle mass and higher relative muscle blood flow increases IM onset
  * Increased V<sub>A</sub>:FRC ratio increases onset of volatiles


* **Distribution**  
  * TBW is 70-75% (compared to 50-60% for an adult), and extracellular water is 40% (compared to 20%), which **increases the V<sub>D</sub>** for administered drugs.
  * Preterm infants have reduced body fat, which affects drug distribution.
  * Greater proportion of cardiac output goes to head, increasing onset of centrally acting (e.g. anaesthetic) drugs
  * Decreased albumin and α<sub>1</sub>-glycoprotein
  * Immature BBB increases uptake of partially ionised drugs
  
  
* **Metabolism**  
  * Enzymatic capacity of all pathways is reduced, which prolongs elimination half-lives and reduces clearance. Hepatically metabolised drugs must be dose adjusted accordingly.
    * The glucuronide pathway may not mature until age 4
    
    
* **Excretion**  
  * **GFR is proportionally lower** and dose not reach adult equivalence until 6-12 months
    * GFR is **further reduced** in **pre-term** infants
    * GFR is increased in **1-3 year** olds

* **Pharmacodynamic**
    * Smaller ACh reserves increase sensitivity to NMBs
    * Increased MAC    
    * NSAIDs cause closures of ductus arteriosus

###Geriatric
Though there is a linear decrease in functional capacity of major systems beginning at 45, alterations are predominantly a consequence of polypharmacy and drug interactions.

* **Absorption**  
Laxatives and prokinetics increase gastric emptying and reduce absorption of oral agents

* **Distribution**  
    * There is a proportional increase in fat  
    * There is a proportional decrease in:
        * Lean body mass
        * Total body water
        * Albumin

* **Metabolism**  
    * ↓ Hepatic blood flow 
    * ↓ Enzymatic activity  
    Phase I > Phase II.

* **Elimination**  
    * Loss of nephron number with age reduces renal clearance

* **Pharmacodynamic**  
    * Increased sensitivity to sedatives, opioids, and hypnotics
    * Decreased sensitivity to β-agonists and antagonists
    * Decreased MAC
    * Polypharmacy increases potential for drug interactions
    
##Alterations in Drug Response: Disease Factors

    * Normal or increased hepatic enzymes


* Elimination
    * Increased renal clearance due to increased CO
