#CVS Changes with Obesity

> Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with morbid obesity

The effect of obesity on the cardiovascular system is complex, and can be classified into:

* Hormonal changes  
Abdominal visceral fat secretes a large number of hormones which affect cardiovascular parameters:
    * Increased leptin  
    Contributes to cardiac remodelling and LVH.
    * Angiotensinogen  
    Leads to systemic hypertension and LV remodelling.
        * Small amounts are produced in adipocytes, which increases as fat volume increases
    * Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1  
    Reduces fibrinolysis and predisposes to VTE.
    * Inflammatory adipokines  
    Impair endothelial function, leading to increased SVR.

        
* Changes in cardiovascular parameters
    * Increased Blood Volume
    * Increased Stroke Volume
    * Increased Cardiac Output
        * Initially with preserved ejection fraction


* Cardiac changes

    * Myocardial fibrosis
    * Fatty infiltration of myocardium
    * Biventricular hypertrophy as a response to increased afterload
        * LV afterload increased due to systemic hypertension
        * RV hypertrophy due to increased PVR, in turn due to:
            * Hypoxia
            Due to increased shunt through collapsed lung bases.
            * Acidosis
