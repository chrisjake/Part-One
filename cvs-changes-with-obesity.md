#CVS Changes with Obesity

> Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with morbid obesity

The effect of obesity on the cardiovascular system is complex, and can be classified into:

* Hormonal changes  
Abdominal visceral fat secretes a large number of hormones which affect cardiovascular parameters:
    * Increased leptin  
    Contributes to cardiac remodelling and LVH.
    * Angiotensinogen  
    Leads to systemic hypertension and LV remodelling.
        * Small amounts are produced in adipocytes, which increases as fat volume increases
    * Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1  
    Reduces fibrinolysis and predisposes to VTE.
    * Inflammatory adipokines  
    Impair endothelial function, leading to increased SVR.

        
* Changes in cardiovascular parameters
    * Increased VO<sub>2</sub>  
    Due to increased LBM and fat mass.
    * Increased Blood Volume  
    Due to increased angiotensin II and aldosterone.
    * Increased Stroke Volume  
    Due to:
        * Increased preload (major factor)
        * Increased contractility (minor factor)  
        Due to increased circulating adrenal hormones.
    * Increased Cardiac Output  
    To maintain DO<sub>2</sub>.
        * Initially with preserved ejection fraction


* Cardiac changes
    * Diastolic dysfunction  
    Due to myocardial fibrosis impairing relaxation.
    * Fatty infiltration of myocardium
    * Biventricular hypertrophy as a response to increased afterload
        * LV afterload increased due to systemic hypertension  
        LVH is much more common than RVH.
        * RV hypertrophy due to increased PVR secondary to:
            * Hypoxia  
            Due to:
                * Effects of OSA
                * Increased shunt through collapsed lung bases
            * Acidosis
