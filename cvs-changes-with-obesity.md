#CVS Changes with Obesity

> Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with morbid obesity

The effect of obesity on the cardiovascular system is complex, and can be classified into:

* Hormonal changes  
Abdominal visceral fat secretes a large number of hormones which affect cardiovascular pparameters:
    * Increased leptin  
    Contributes to cardiac remodelling and LVH.
    * Angiotensinogen  
    Leads to systemic hypertension and LV remodelling.
        * Small amounts are produced in adipocytes, which increases as fat volume increases
    * Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1  
    Reduces fibrinolysis and predisposes to VTE.
    
    
* Circulatory changes
    * Increased Blood Volume


* General cardiac changes
    * Increased Stroke Volume
    * Increased Cardiac Output
        * Initially with preserved ejection fraction
    * Myocardial fibrosis
    * Fatty infiltration of myocardium
    * Biventricular hypertrophy as a response to increased afterload
        * LV afterload increased due to systemic hypertension
        * RV hypertrophy due to increased PVR, in turn due to:
            * Hypoxia
            Due to increased shunt through collapsed lung bases.
            * Acidosis        

                
* Left heart changes
    * LVH as an adaptive response to increased afterload  
    Afterload is increased due to systemic hypertension.


* Right heart changes
    * RVH as an adaptive response to increased afterload  
    Afterload increased due to increased PVR, secondary to:
