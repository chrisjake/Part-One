> Describe the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling

Skeletal muscle has a number of functions:
* Facilitate movement
* Maintenance of posture  
Via tonic contraction of antagonistic muscle groups.
* Soft tissue support  
Abdominal wall and pelvic floor support viscera.
* Voluntary sphincter control
* Heat production

##Structure
Skeletal muscle consists of long tubular cells, known as muscle fibres, which run the length of the muscle. Skeletal muscle cells:
* Are under voluntary control from the somatic nervous system via α-motor fibres
* Are 10-100μm in diameter
* Contain several hundred peripheral nuclei
* Appear striated microscopically due to the arrangement of myofibrils

Muscle fibres are surrounded by layers of connective tissue:
* Endomysium  
Thin layer which surrounds each muscle fibre.
* Perimysium  
Surrounds bundles of muscle fibres.
* Epimysium  
Thick layer which surrounds an entire muscle.

These layers of connective tissue join at the end of a muscle to form a tendon or aponeurosis.

###Sarcomere
The sarcomere is the functional contractile unit of muscle. Average sarcomere length is 2.5μm.

It has a number of components, each with a number of proteins:
* A-band: Myosin (**thick**) filaments  
Myosin is a large protein with two heads, which bind actin and ATP. The mysosin head flexes on its neck during contraction.

* H-band: The part of the myosin filaments which doesn't overlap with actin filaments

* I-band: Actin (**thin**) filaments  
  **Actin** is a smaller protein than myosin, and potentiates the ATPase of myosin. Actin filaments have a groove which contains another protein called **tropomyosin**, to which **troponin** attaches to. Troponin has three subunits:
    * Troponin T - binds troponin to tropomyosin
    * Troponin I - prevents myosin binding to actin by physically obstructing the binding site
    * Troponin C - Binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> which initiates contraction


* Z-line: Each end of the sarcomere  
Actin from adjacent sarcomeres are connected at the Z line.

* M-line: Band of connections between myosin filaments

##Excitation-Contraction Coupling
Muscle contraction normally requires the coordination of electrical (signaling) events with mechanical events.

* In response to ACh stimulating nicotinic receptors, the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductance of the end-plate increase and an **end-plate potential** is generated
* Muscle fibres undergo successive depolarisation and an action potential is generated along T tubules  
These deliver the AP deep into the cell, and close to the SR.
* Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum  
This process involves:
    * Dihydropyridine Receptor  
    Specialised voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, activated by T-tubular depolarisation. Responsible for a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport.
    * Ryanodine Receptor  
    A second Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel which is attached to, and activated by, the dihydropyridine receptor, causing a much larger release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.


* Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the SR (increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> 2000x) and binds to **troponin C**, weakening the troponin I - actin link and uncovering myosin-binding sites on actin
* Cross-linkages form between actin and myosin, which releases ADP
* The release of ADP triggers a **power stroke**, which is a process of attachment, pulling, and detachment. Each cycle shortens the sarcomere by **~10nm**:
    * The myosin head rotates on its 'neck', moving to a new actin binding site
    * ATP binds to the (now free) binding site on the mysoin
    * ATP is hydrolysed to ADP, in the process "re-cocking" the myosin head. This process causes the thick and think filaments to slide on each other, with the myosin heads pulling the actin filaments to the centre of the sarcomere. Therefore:
        * The A-band is unchanged
        * The H-band shortens
        * The I-band shortens
 

* Power strokes continue as long as there is ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> available

* In relaxation:
    * Ca<sup>2+</sup> is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
    * Troponin releases Ca<sup>2+</sup>
    * Binding sites are occluded by troponin, and no further contraction occurs
