#Organelles
> Describe the cell membrane and cellular organelles and their properties

Organelles are specialised fucntional subunits within a cell, typically contained within their own lipid bilayer.

Key organelles include:
* Mitochondria
* Endoplasmic reticulum
* Golgi apparatus

##Mitochondria
Mitochondria:
* Produce ATP via aerobic metabolism  
Only method of aerobic metabolism in the body.
    * Mitrochondria exist in greater numbers in more metabolically active cells
* Consist of two membranes (outer and inner), which create three spaces, 
    * Cytoplasm  
    Outside the outer membrane.
    * Intermembrane space  
    Between the membranes.
        * Outer membrane separates mitochondria from cytoplasm, but contains pores allowing some substances (pyruvate, amino acids, fatty acids) to pass
        * Inner membrane:
            * Isolates the electron transport chain from the intermembrane (space between inner and outer membranes) space.
            * Proteins on the inner membrane conduct redox reactions important in ATP production
            * Electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space
    * Inner mitochondrial matrix  
    Contents important in many metabolic processes:
        * Citric acid cycle
        * Fatty acid metabolism
        * Urea cycle
        * Haeme synthesis
