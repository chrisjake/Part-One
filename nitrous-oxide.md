#Nitrous Oxide


|Property|Nitrous Oxide|Entonox (50% O<sub>2</sub>, 50% N<sub>2</sub>O)
|--|--|
|**Pharmaceutics**|Non-flammable. Produced by heating ammonium nitrate to 250°C.<br><br> **Stored as a liquid**, such that the gauge pressure is only accurate when all remaining N<sub>2</sub>O is in the gaseous phase.<br><br> The **filling ratio** is the mass of N<sub>2</sub>O in the cylinder compared to the mass of water it could hold, and is **0.75** in temperature regions, and **0.67** in warmer regions.| The gases dissolve each other and behave differently than would be expected from their individual properties. This is the **Poynting effect**.
|**Molecular Weight**|
|**Boiling point**|-88°C
|**Critical Temperature/Pressure**|36.5°C / 72 bar| *Pseudo*critical temperature of -7°C, below which it will separate into **liquid** 50% N<sub>2</sub>O (with some dissolved O<sub>2</sub>), and gaseous O<sub>2</sub>. Most likely to occur at 117 bar. This can lead to delivery of a hypoxic mixture.
|**SVP**|
|**Blood:gas coefficient**|0.47
|**Oil:gas coefficient**|1.4
|**MAC**|105
|**Metabolism**|<0.01% metabolised.
|**Resp**|Diffusion hypoxia due to second gas effect. Small ↓ in V<sub>T</sub>, ↑ in RR such that MV is unchanged.
|**CVS**|↑ SNS tone, mild myocardial depression.
|**CNS**|Analgesic via endorphin and encephalin modulation, and on opioid receptors. ↑ CBF.
|**GIT**|N/V.
|**Immune**|
|**Metabolic**|
|**Toxic Effects**|High diffusing capacity means it will rapidly diffuse into air-filled cavities, increasing the volume of compliant cavities (PTHx, bowel), and increasing the pressure of non-compliant cavities (middle ear). <br><br> Inhibits **methionine synthetase**, which can cause demyelination in the dorsal columns (acutely) and the spinal cord (subacutely in the setting of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. <br><br> Potentially teratogenic - avoid in early pregnancy. <br><br> Greenhouse gas.
