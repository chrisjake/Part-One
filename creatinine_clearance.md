#Measurement of GFR
> Describe the principles of measurement of glomerular filtration rate ~~and renal blood flow~~

Renal clearance of a substance quantifies the effectiveness of kidneys in excreting substances. The definition of clearance is the *volume* (typically of plasma) cleared of a drug per unit time. Renal clearance can therefore be expressed as:

$$Cl = { U_C.U_Q \over P_C}$$, where:
* $$Cl$$ = Clearance
* $$U_C$$ = Urine concentration
* $$U_Q$$ = Urine flow rate
* $$P_C$$ = Plasma concentration

As the elimination of most substances is dependent on glomerular filtration, clearance can be used to estimate GFR. **Inulin** is an exogenous molecule which is typically used for this purpose. It is not produced by the body, is freely filtered, and not reabsorbed. However, it has to be given by IV infusion which limits its clinical utility.

##Creatinine
Creatine is a byproduct of muscle catabolism, and has a number of properties that make it an optimal measure of renal function:
* Produced at a relatively constant rate
* Not metabolised
* Freely filtered by the glomerulus
* Minimally excreted
* Not reabsorbed

GFR can therefore be approximated by creatinine clearance (assuming steady-state):

$$GFR \approx Cl_{Cr} = {U_{[Cr]}.U_Q \over P_{[Cr]}}$$

Factors affecting creatinine production:
* Race
* Muscle mass
    * Age
    * Sex
* Diet

###Plasma Creatinine
This formula demonstrates that GFR is inversely proportional to plasma creatinine concentration. Therefore, if plasma creatinine doubles GFR should approximately halve provided plasma creatinine **is in steady state**. During acute changes in GFR, serum creatinine will underestimate GFR until a new steady state is reached. In addition, as glomerular filtration deteriorates the proportion of creatinine secreted by renal tubules becomes larger, so creatinine will overestimate GFR when GFR is low.

###Creatinine Clearance
A better approximation is to use the whole formula above. This relies on a 24 hour urine collection to determine the volume of urine and the urinary creatinine concentration.

However, it also may over-estimate the GFR and AKI, as the change in plasma creatinine with GFR is delayed (creatinine must be produced and not eliminated for it to rise).

####Estimating Creatinine Clearance
Creatinine clearance requires a 24 hour urine collection. This is tedious, and so it can be estimated using the **Cockcroft-Gault formula**, which has a correlation of ~0.83 with creatinine clearance:

$$Cl = (140-A) \times W  \times S  \times 72  \times Cr)$$, where:
* $$Cl$$ = Clearance
* $$A$$ = Age
* $$S$$ = Sex coefficent (Male = 1, Female = 0.85)
* $$Cr$$ = Creatinine in Âµmol.L<sup>-1</sup>

Alternative formulas are **MDRD** and **CKD-EPI**. These equations have two advantages of Cockroft-Gault:
* They are better predictors of GFR
* They do not require weight, and so can be calculated by the laboratory automatically (other data can be taken from hospital records)

These estimates have similar weaknesses to the above:
* Dependent on serum creatinine, which can be highly variable. Formulas are derived from average values of dependent variables, and so will be unreliable at extremes of:
    * Age
    * Muscle mass
    * Critically ill
    * Malignancy
    * Diet
