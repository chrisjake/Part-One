#Measurement of GFR
> Describe the principles of measurement of glomerular filtration rate ~~and renal blood flow~~

Renal clearance of a substance quantifies the effectiveness of kidneys in excreting substances. The definition of clearance is the *volume* (typically of plasma) cleared of a drug per unit time. Renal clearance can therefore be expressed as:

$$Cl = { U_C.U_Q \over P_C}$$, where:
* $$Cl$$ = Clearance
* $$U_C$$ = Urine concentration
* $$U_Q$$ = Urine flow rate
* $$P_C$$ = Plasma concentration

##Clearance and GFR
As the elimination of most substances is dependent on glomerular filtration, clearance of a substance can be used to estimate GFR. Methods include:
* **Inulin**  
Inulin is a naturally occcurring polysaccharide.
    * Inulin clearance accurately measures GFR as it is:
        * Freely filtered by the glomerulus
        * Not secreted at the tubules
        * Not reabsorbed
    * However, inulin is not produced by the body and so must be given by IV infusion  
    This limits its clinical utility.
* **Creatinine**  
Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle catabolism.
    * Creatinine is used clinically to measure renal function because it is:
        * Produced at a relatively constant rate  
        Factors affecting creatinine production include:
            * Race
            * Muscle mass
                * Age
                * Sex
            * Diet
        * Not metabolised
        * Freely filtered by the glomerulus
        * Minimally secreted  
        As GFR fallsthe *proportion* of creatinine secreted by renal tubules increases, so plasma creatinine will overestimate GFR when GFR is low.
        * Not reabsorbed
    * GFR can be approximated by creatinine clearance  
    This is given by the equation: $$GFR \approx Cl_{Cr} = {U_{[Cr]}.U_Q \over P_{[Cr]}}$$
    
    


###Plasma Creatinine
This formula demonstrates that **GFR is inversely proportional to plasma creatinine** concentration.
* **This is only true when both creatinine production and glomerular filtration are at steady-state**  
A sudden drop in glomerular filtration (e.g. aortic cross-clamp) will not result in an immediate rise in creatinine.
    * During acute changes in GFR, serum creatinine will underestimate GFR until a new steady state is reached  
    Creatinine must be produced and not eliminated for it to rise.

###Estimating Creatinine Clearance
Using the above formula requires measurement of urine volume. This is:
* Typically performed by taking a 24 hour urine collection.
* Tedious, and so creatinine clearance is often estimated  
A common method is the **Cockcroft-Gault formula**, which has a correlation of ~0.83 with creatinine clearance:  
$$Cl = (140-A) \times W  \times S  \times 72  \times Cr)$$, where:
    * $$Cl$$ = Clearance
    * $$A$$ = Age
    * $$S$$ = Sex coefficent (Male = 1, Female = 0.85)
    * $$Cr$$ = Creatinine in Âµmol.L<sup>-1</sup>

Alternative formulas are **MDRD** and **CKD-EPI**. These equations have two advantages of Cockroft-Gault:
* They are better predictors of GFR
* They do not require weight, and so can be calculated by the laboratory automatically (other data can be taken from hospital records)

These estimates have similar weaknesses to the above:
* Dependent on serum creatinine, which can be highly variable. Formulas are derived from average values of dependent variables, and so will be unreliable at extremes of:
    * Age
    * Muscle mass
    * Critically ill
    * Malignancy
    * Diet
