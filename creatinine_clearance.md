#Measurement of GFR
> Describe the principles of measurement of glomerular filtration rate ~~and renal blood flow~~

Renal clearance of a substance quantifies the effectiveness of kidneys in excreting substances. The definition of clearance is the *volume* (typically of plasma) cleared of a drug per unit time. Renal clearance can therefore be expressed as:

$$Cl = { U_C.U_Q \over P_C}$$, where:
* $$Cl$$ = Clearance
* $$U_C$$ = Urine concentration
* $$U_Q$$ = Urine flow rate
* $$P_C$$ = Plasma concentration

##Clearance and GFR
As the elimination of most substances is dependent on glomerular filtration, clearance of a substance can be used to estimate GFR. Methods include:
* **Inulin**  
Inulin is a naturally occcurring polysaccharide.
    * Inulin clearance accurately measures GFR as it is:
        * Freely filtered by the glomerulus
        * Not secreted at the tubules
        * Not reabsorbed
    * However, inulin is not produced by the body and so must be given by IV infusion  
    This limits its clinical utility.
* **Creatinine**  
Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle catabolism. Creatinine is used clinically to measure renal function because it is:
    * Produced at a relatively constant rate  
    Factors affecting creatinine production include:
        * Race
        * Muscle mass
            * Age
            * Sex
        * Diet
    * Not metabolised
    * Freely filtered by the glomerulus
    * Minimally secreted  
    This is a source of error with creatinine, especially as renal function deteriorates as a greater proportion of cleared creatinine will be secreted by the tubules, rather than filtered at the glomerulus.
    * Not reabsorbed

GFR can be approximated by creatinine clearance, provided both creatinine production and glomerular filtration are at steady-state (a sudden drop in renal function will not result in an immediate rise in creatinine):

$$GFR \approx Cl_{Cr} = {U_{[Cr]}.U_Q \over P_{[Cr]}}$$



###Plasma Creatinine
This formula demonstrates that GFR is inversely proportional to plasma creatinine concentration. Therefore, if plasma creatinine doubles GFR should approximately halve provided plasma creatinine **is in steady state**. During acute changes in GFR, serum creatinine will underestimate GFR until a new steady state is reached. In addition, as glomerular filtration deteriorates the proportion of creatinine secreted by renal tubules becomes larger, so creatinine will overestimate GFR when GFR is low.

###Creatinine Clearance
A better approximation is to use the whole formula above. This relies on a 24 hour urine collection to determine the volume of urine and the urinary creatinine concentration.

However, it also may over-estimate the GFR and AKI, as the change in plasma creatinine with GFR is delayed (creatinine must be produced and not eliminated for it to rise).

####Estimating Creatinine Clearance
Creatinine clearance requires a 24 hour urine collection. This is tedious, and so it can be estimated using the **Cockcroft-Gault formula**, which has a correlation of ~0.83 with creatinine clearance:

$$Cl = (140-A) \times W  \times S  \times 72  \times Cr)$$, where:
* $$Cl$$ = Clearance
* $$A$$ = Age
* $$S$$ = Sex coefficent (Male = 1, Female = 0.85)
* $$Cr$$ = Creatinine in Âµmol.L<sup>-1</sup>

Alternative formulas are **MDRD** and **CKD-EPI**. These equations have two advantages of Cockroft-Gault:
* They are better predictors of GFR
* They do not require weight, and so can be calculated by the laboratory automatically (other data can be taken from hospital records)

These estimates have similar weaknesses to the above:
* Dependent on serum creatinine, which can be highly variable. Formulas are derived from average values of dependent variables, and so will be unreliable at extremes of:
    * Age
    * Muscle mass
    * Critically ill
    * Malignancy
    * Diet
