# Antiplatelets

*Note aspirin is included under [COX inhibitors](cox_inhibitors.md)*.

##Classification of Antiplatelet Agents
Antiplatelet agents can be classified by which stage of platelet function they affect:
* Adhesion
    * vWF inhibitors  
    e.g. Dextran 70.
* Activation
    * Prostacyclins  
    e.g. Epoprostenol.
    * Phosphodiesterase inhibition  
    e.g. Dipyridiamole.
    * COX inhibitors  
    Prevent thromboxane A2 production, e.g. aspirin.
* Aggregation
    * ADP receptor antagonists  
    Prevent activation of GP IIb/IIIa receptors, e.g. clopidogrel.
    * GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists  
    Prevent platelet aggregation via fibrin linkages between GP IIb/IIIa receptors, e.g. tirofiban.

##Comparison of Common Antiplatelet Agents
|Property|Clopidogrel|Dipyridamole|Tirofiban
|--|--|
|**Class**|ADP antagonist|Phosphodisterase inhibitor|GP IIb/IIa antagonisits
|**Uses**|PVD, STEMI, NSTEMI, stent prophylaxis|CVA|UA, NSTEMI
|**Route of Administration**|PO only|PO/IV|IV only
|**Mechanism of Action**|Irreversibly prevents ADP from binding to its receptor on the platelet, preventing activation of the IIb/IIIa receptor|Inhibits platelet adhision to walls, potentiates prostacyclin activity and increases platelet cAMP, â†“ Ca<sup>2+</sup> and inhibiting platelet aggregation and deformation. Also acts as a coronary vasodilator.|Reversible antagonism of IIb/IIIa receptor, preventing platelet aggregation
|**Dosing**|300mg load, 75mg daily thereafter|200mg BD for CVA|Load 25 mcg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, maintenance 15mcg.kg<sup>-1</sup>
|**Absorption**|Rapid absorption and onset within 2 hours|Variable depending on oral intake|IV only. Onset within 10 minutes
|**Distribution**|Highly protein-bound drug and metabolites|Highly protein bound|65% protein bound
|**Metabolism**|**Prodrug**. Majority hydrolysed by esterases to inactive drug, with a small proportion hepatically metabolised by **CYP450** to active form. Prolonged duration of action due to irreversible ADP blockade rather than long elimination half-life.|Partial hepatic to inactive metabolites|Not metabolised.
|**Elimination**|Urinary and faecal|Renal and faecal|Urinary as unchanged drug. Platelet aggregation returns to baseline within 4-8 hours
|**CVS**||Vasodilatation may drop CPP in AS and recent MI|Coronary artery dissection
|**GIT**|Mucosal irritation|||
|**Haeme**|Haemorrhage|Thrombocytopaenia and haemorrhage|Haemorrhage
|**Other**|Many pharmacokinetic interactions, including genetic variability. Previously thought to kinetically interact with omeprazole - more recently disproven.||||
