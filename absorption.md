# Absorption

> Describe absorption and factors that will influence it.

Absorption is dependent on the route of administration. Routes of administration are selected based on:

* Effect site of the drug
* Drug factors
  * Bioavailability
  * Available preparations
* Patient factors
  * Ability to take or absorb oral medications
  * Preference

## Key concepts

**Bioavailability** is the percentage of drug given which reaches the systemic circulation, compared to the IV form. It is affected by:

* Formulation
* Physicochemical: Interactions with other drugs and food
* Patient: Malabsorption syndromes, gastric stasis
* First-pass metabolism

**First-pass ** \(pre-systemic\) ** metabolism** is the extent to which drug concentration is reduced after its first passage through an organ before reaching the systemic circulation. First pass metabolism is:
* Typically used when referring to passage of orally-adminstered drugs through the liver  
May also refer to metabolism by the:
  * Lungs  
  First pass of intravenously injected drugs prior to entering the arterial side of the circulation
  * Vascular endothelium
* Relevant in:
  * Understanding the difference between PO and IV dosing
    * Alternative routes of adminsitration for drugs with low PO bioavailability
  * Delivery of prodrugs via PO mechanisms  
  Increases active drug concentration.
  * Understanding enzyme interactions 
  * Understanding the effects of hepatic disease
    * Porto-systemic shunts decrease first pass metabolism
    * Altered bioavailability of drugs with high hepatic extraction ratios
    

## Routes of administration

### Intravenous

* Rapid Onset
* 100% bioavailability \(may have pulmonary first-pass metabolism for drugs which are metabolised in pulmonary circulation, such as fentanyl, lignocaine, propofol, and catecholamines\)

### Oral

* Absorption is through gut mucosa, through either:
  * Transport mechanisms
  * Unionised \(lipid soluble\)
    * Acidic drugs are absorbed more rapidly in the stomach
    * The small bowel absorbs both acid and alkaline drugs due to high surface area
* Lowest bioavailability of any route due to:
  * First-pass metabolism
  * Gut metabolism of drugs
  * Bacterial metabolism of drugs
* Drugs must be lipid soluble enough to cross cell-membranes and water soluble enough to cross interstitium

#### Factors affecting GIT Absorption

* Drug Factors
  * Molecular Weight
  * Concentration Gradient
  * Lipid solubility
  * Pharmaceutical Preparation
  * Physiochemical interactions
    * Food
    * Other drugs

* Patient Factors
  * GIT blood flow
  * Surface Area
    * SB has the largest surface area of any GIT organ
  * pH
  * Motility
  * Digestive Enzymes
  * GIT bacteria and subsequent metabolism
  * Disease
    * Critical Illness
    * Bowel Obstruction
    * Emesis/Diarrhoea

### Epidural

* May be via bolus or infusion
* Onset determined by proportion of unionised drug available
* Additional factors include additives and intrinsic vasoactive properties of the delivered drug

_This is why lignocaine can be used for rapid analgesia through an epidural, as it has a pKa of 7.7 and has a greater portion uninionised than bupivicaine \(pKa 8.4\) at physiological pH. _

### Subarachnoid/Intrathecal

* Very small dosing
* Minimal systemic spread
* Extent of subarachnoid spread is dependent on volume and type of solution
* Appropriate positioning of the patient, with higher-specific gravity solutions, is required to avoid superior spread of the block
* Additional factors include additives and intrinsic vasoactive properties of the delivered drug

### Inhalation

* Systemic absorption dependent on particle size
  * &lt;1 micron diameter may reach the alveolus
* Rapid diffusion to circulation due to high surface area and no first-pass metabolism

### Transdermal

* Systemic absorption dependent on:
* Surface area
* Regional blood flow
* Lipid solubility

### Subcutaneous

* Absorption dependent on regional blood flow

### Sublingual

* Rapid onset
* Bypass portal circulation \(drains into SVC\)

### Rectal

* Slow and incomplete absorption
* Partial bypass of the portal circulation - ~50% bioavailability

### Intramuscular

* Bioavailability close to 1
* Absorption dependent on regional blood flow
* Potential local complications:
  * Abscess
  * Haematoma
