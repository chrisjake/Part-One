# Absorption

> Describe absorption and factors that will influence it.

Absorption is dependent on the route of administration. Routes of administration are selected based on:

* Effect site of the drug
* Drug factors
  * Bioavailability
  * Available preparations
* Patient factors
  * Ability to take or absorb oral medications
  * Preference

## Key Concepts

**Bioavailability** is the **proportion of drug given which reaches the systemic circulation unchanged**, compared to the IV form. It is affected by:

* Formulation
* Physicochemical Interactions  
Interactions with other drugs and food.
* Patient Factors  
  * Malabsorption syndrome
  * Gastric stasis
* First-pass metabolism

**First-pass ** \(pre-systemic\) ** metabolism** is the extent to which drug concentration is reduced after its first passage through an organ, prior to reaching the systemic circulation. First pass metabolism is:
* Typically used when referring to passage of orally-adminstered drugs through the liver  
May also refer to metabolism by the:
  * Lungs  
  First pass of intravenously injected drugs prior to entering the arterial side of the circulation, e.g. fentanyl.
  * Vascular endothelium
* Relevant in:
  * Understanding differences between PO and IV dosing
    * Alternative routes of administration for drugs with low PO bioavailability
  * Delivery of prodrugs via PO mechanisms  
  Increases active drug concentration.
  * Understanding enzyme interactions 
  * Understanding the effects of hepatic disease
    * Porto-systemic shunts decrease first pass metabolism
    * Altered bioavailability of drugs with high hepatic extraction ratios
    

## Routes of administration

### Intravenous

* Rapid Onset
* 100% bioavailability  
Some drugs may still undergo metabolism in the pulmonary circulation, such as fentanyl, lignocaine, propofol, and catecholamines.

### Oral

* Absorption is through gut mucosa, through either:
  * Transport mechanisms
  * Unionised \(lipid soluble\)
    * Acidic drugs are absorbed more rapidly in the stomach
    * The small bowel absorbs both acid (despite being ionised) and alkaline drugs due to high surface area
* Lowest bioavailability of any route due to:
  * First-pass metabolism
  * Gut metabolism of drugs
  * Bacterial metabolism of drugs
* Drugs must be lipid soluble enough to cross cell-membranes and water soluble enough to cross interstitium

#### Factors affecting GIT Absorption

* Drug Factors
  * Molecular Weight
  * Concentration Gradient
  * Lipid Solubility
    * pH and pKa
  * Pharmaceutical Preparation
  * Physiochemical Interactions
    * Food
    * Other drugs



* Patient Factors
  * GIT blood flow
  * Surface Area
    * Small bowel has the largest surface area of any GIT organ
  * pH
  * Motility
  * Digestive Enzymes
  * GIT bacteria and subsequent metabolism
  * Disease
    * Critical Illness
    * Bowel Obstruction
    * Emesis/Diarrhoea

### Epidural

* May be via bolus or infusion
* Onset determined by proportion of unionised drug available  
Lignocaine has a more rapid epidural onset than bupivacaine as it has a pKa of 7.7 (compared to 8.4) and therefore a greater unionised portion at physiologic pH.


* Additional factors include additives and intrinsic vasoactive properties of the delivered drug


### Subarachnoid/Intrathecal

* Very small dosing
* Minimal systemic spread
* Extent of subarachnoid spread is dependent on volume and type of solution
* Appropriate positioning of the patient, with higher-specific gravity solutions, is required to avoid superior spread of the block
* Additional factors include additives and intrinsic vasoactive properties of the delivered drug

### Inhalation

* Systemic absorption dependent on particle size
  * Large particles reach the bronchioles
  * < 1 micron diameter particles may reach the alveolus
* Rapid diffusion to circulation due to high surface area and no first-pass metabolism

### Transdermal

* Systemic absorption dependent on:
  * Dose requirement
    * Large dose requirements cannot be effectively given transdermally
  * Fick Principle
   * Amount of drug given
   * Amount of drug in skin
     * Regional blood flow
       * Histamine release
   * Surface Area
   * Skin thickness
   * Lipid solubility
     * pH of skin and emulsion
     * pKa of drug
   * Molecular weight
 * Advantages
   * Convenient
   * Painless
   * No first pass metabolism
   * Steady plasma concentration once established
 * Disadvantages
   * Slow onset
   * Variable plasma concentration initially
   * Overdose and abuse potentials

### Subcutaneous

* Absorption dependent on regional blood flow

### Sublingual

* Rapid onset
* Bypass portal circulation \(drains into SVC\)

### Rectal

* Variable absorption
  * Distal rectal absorption bypasses portal circulation
  * Proximal rectal absorption does not and may result in hepaticfirst pass metabolism
  * Small surface area for absorption


### Intramuscular

* Bioavailability close to 1
* Absorption dependent on regional blood flow
* Potential local complications:
  * Abscess
  * Haematoma
