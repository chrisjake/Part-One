# Insulins {#id}

Insulins are synthetic polypeptide hormones with a similar mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics of endogenous insulin.

##Types of Insulin
Different insulins are categorised by their time of **onset**, **peak**, and **duration**, and are classified as either:
* Fast acting
* Intermediate acting
* Long acting

###Fast Acting
Fast acting insulins are used for controlling BSL spikes post meals, and for control of hyperglycaemia. Administered subcutaneously they have have an:
* Onset of 5-15 minutes
* Peak at 1-2 hours
* Last 4-6 hours.

Fast acting insulins include:
* Insulin Aspart (Novorapid)
* Insulin Lispro (Humalog)

###Intermediate Acting
Intermediate Acting insulins are used for control of BSL between meals as a pseudo-basal bolus. Administered subcutaneously they have an:
* Onset of 1-2 hours
* Peak at 4-6 hours
* Last >12 hours

Intermediate acting insulins include:
* NPH
* Protophane

###Long Acting
Long acting insulins are used for creating a baseline insulin level. Administered subcutaneously they have an:
* Onset of 1-1.5 hours
* Peak at 5 hours
* Last 24 hours

Long-acting insulins include:
* Insulin glargine (Lantus)
* Insulin detemir (Levemir)

##Pharmacokinetics of Exogenous Insulin Preparations
|Property|Drug
|--|--|
|**Class**|Synthetic polypeptide hormones
|**Uses**| Diabetes, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, Î²-blocker toxicity, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-blocker toxicity
|**Presentation**| Clear colourless solution typically at 100 IU.ml<sup>-1</sup>
|**Route of Administration**|SC, IM, IV
|**Absorption**| Variable, as described
|**Distribution**| Minimal protein binding and minimal redistribution out of ECF - V<sub>D</sub> 0.075L.kg<sup>-1</sup>
|**Metabolism**| Glutathione insulin transhydrogenase. Metabolism is constant - duration of action is entirely due to different rates of subcutaneous absorption.
|**Elimination**| Renal of inactive metabolites
