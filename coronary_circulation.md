##Vascular Anatomy
###Coronary Artery Anatomy
The **left** coronary artery arises from the posterior aortic sinus superior to the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve. Eddy currents produced the **sinuses of Valsalva** (out-pockets of the aortic wall) prevent the valves from occluding the os of the LM and RCA during systole, and so they remains patent throughout the cardiac cycle. The **left main** is 5-10mm long, and bifurcates into the LAD and LCx. 

The **LAD** courses along the **anterior interventricular groove** to the apex of the herat, where it anastomoses with the posterior descending artery from the RCA. The LAD **supplies** the **anterolateral myocardium** and **anterior 2/3** of the interventricular **septum**. **Branches** of the LAD may be either **diagonal** or **septal perforators**. Branches are named successively from proximal to distal, i.e. LADD<sub>1</sub>, LADD<sub>2</sub>, etc.

The **LCx** courses along the **left antrioventricular** groove between the LA and LV in the epicardial fat pad. It **supplies** the **lateral and posterior** walls of the **LV**. The LCx gives off three **obtuse marginal** branches (OM<sub>1</sub>, OM<sub>2</sub>) which follow the left margin of the heart. It runs in close approximation with the coronary sinus for much of its course.

The **right** coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus superior to the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve. The RCA courses vertically downwards in the **right atrioventricular groove** and supplies the RA and RV.

The LCx and RCA travel in opposite directions around the atrioventricular groove. The **posterior descending artery** has its origin from one of these vessels, and unsurprisingly descends in the posterior interventricular groove before coursing along the base to anastomose with the LAD at the apex of the heart.

####Coronary Dominance
Coronary dominance refers to the variable coronary supply of the SA and AV node. The **SA node** is supplied by the **RCA in 60%** of individuals, whilst the **AV node** is supplied by the **RCA in 90%** of individuals. In a **right-dominant** circulation the PDA is supplied by the **RCA**, and the **LCx** in a **left-dominant** circulation.

###Venous Anatomy
* 85% of venous drainage occurs via the **coronary sinus**, which is formed from the cardiac veins:
  * The **great cardiac vein** runs with the LAD
  * The **middle cardiac vein** follows the PDA
  * The **small cardiac vein** runs with the RCA
  * The **oblique vein** follows the posterior part of the LA
* Most of the remainder is via **anterior cardiac veins** which drain directly into the RA
* A small proportion of blood from the left side of the heart is drained via the **thebesian veins** directly into the cardiac chambers

##Coronary Blood Flow
At rest, CBF is **~250ml.min<sup>-1</sup>** (~5% of resting CO), and may increase 4x during strenuous exercise. Myocardial work may increase up to 9x, though as myocardial oxygen extraction is unchanged efficiency is actually improved during exercise.

GUYTON CORONARY BLOOD FLOW DIAGRAM pg 250


CBF is dependent on coronary vascular resistance and coronary perfusion pressure, which is the difference between aortic root pressure and intracavity pressure: i.e. $$ CBF = {P_{Aorta} - P_{Cavity} \over CVR } $$

Note that the pressure gradient is from Aorta-Cavity rather than Aorta-RA. The pressure in the ventricle acts as a Starling resistor - coronary flow is independent of RAP.

LV CBF is reduced in systole as contracting myocardium compresses intramuscular vessels and increases CVR. RV CBF is less affected, as the force of contraction is significantly smaller and a pressure gradient is maintained. Tachycardia reduces diastolic time and subsequently LV CBF.

###Control of Coronary Blood Flow
CBF is **autoregulated**:
* **Myogenic autoregulation**  
  This is common to many organ systems, and occurs within the coronaries.
  * Increasing transmural pressure increases the leakiness of smooth muscle membranes, depolarising them
  * Resistance increases proportionally to pressure, such that flow remains constant
* **Metabolic autoregulation**  
Anaerobic metabolism results in production of vasoactive mediates such as **lactate** and **adenosine**, which stimulate vasodilation and an increase in flow (and therefore oxygen delivery).
  * This is the predominant means for autoregulation in the heart
  * Typical **myocardial oxygen extraction is 70%** and raising this further is difficult  
  Therefore, increasing oxygen supply requires an increase in blood flow.



**Autonomic** mechanisms also control some aspects of coronary blood flow:  
These autonomic local autoregulation.
* **Direct** effects include:
  * Parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of coronary vessels, with release of ACh or NA and A decreasing or increasing coronary blood flow
*  **Indirect** effects
  *  Are more important than direct effects
  *  Are related to autoregulation occurring with changing levels of myocardial work in response to parasympathetic or sympathetic stimuli
