#Laboratory Assessment of Liver Function

> Describe the laboratory assessment of liver function

##Synthetic Function
Measures of synthetic function include:
*  Albumin  
Main plasma protein.
    * Normal range 28-58g.L<sup>-1</sup>
    * Half-life ~20 days
    * Important in:
        * Maintenance of plasma oncotic pressure
        * Binding
            * Calcium
            * Drugs
    * Decreased in liver dysfunction and malnutrition


        
* Coagulation Assays  
Clotting factors are produced by the liver. Hepatic impairment may result in reduced production, and abnormality of clotting assays, although functional clotting function may be normal (as pro-coagulant proteins are affected to a similar extent).
    * INR  
    Test of the extrinsic pathway.
    * APTT
    Test of intrinsic pathway.
    
##Metabolic Function
Transaminases are released when liver parenchyma is damaged, and are used to evaluate metabolic function:
* ALT
    * Normal range < 54 U.L<sup>-1</sup>
* AST
    * Normal range < 35 U.L<sup>-1</sup>

##Obstructive Tests
* ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)  
Enzyme involved in dephosphorylation of many compounds. ALP is found in all cells, but particularly in the liver, bile duct, bone, kidney, and placenta.
    * Normal range is 30-120 U.L<sup>-1</sup>
* GGT  
Enzyme found in biliary duct.
    * Normal range:
        * Males: 11-50 U.L<sup>-1</sup>
        * Females: 7-30 U.L<sup>-1</sup>
* Bilirubin  
Byproduct of haemaglobin metabolism. May be measured as total, or as conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin.
