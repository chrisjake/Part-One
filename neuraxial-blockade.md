#Neuraxial Blockade
> <p style="color:purple";>Describe the physiological consequences of a central neuraxial block</p>

Central neuraxial blockade refers to blockade of fibres in the spinal cord by administration of intrathecal or epidural local anaesthetic.

##Cardiovascular Responses
Occur due to blockade of sympathetic chain fibres in the thoracolumbar region.

An increasing level of block will lead to greater effects:
* Sacral  
Parasympathetic blockade only. Minimal CVS effects.
* Lower thoracic/lumbar  
Arteriolar and venous vasodilation in lower abdomen and lower limbs, causing a fall in SVR, BP, and GFR.
* Upper thoracic  
Loss of cardioaccelerator fibres above T5, causing a reduction in heart rate and contractility, compounding hypotension due to fall in SVR.
* Brainstem  
Inhibition of vasomotor centre with profound fall in CVS parameters.
