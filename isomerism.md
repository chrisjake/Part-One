#Isomerism {#id}
>Describe isomerism and provide examples

**Isomerism** describes groups of compounds which have the same chemical formula but different chemical stuctures. Isomerism is revelant because different isomers may have different enzymatic and receptor affinities, altering their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

##Types of Isomerism
Isomers can be divided into:
* **Structural Isomers**  
Atoms are connected in entirely different orders, and may contain different functional groups. Structural isomerism is subdivided into:
    * **Static**  
    Further subdivided into:
        * Chain isomer  
        The carbon skeleton varies, but position of functional groups is static.
        * Position isomer  
        The carbon skeleton is static, but the position of functional groups varies.
            * e.g. isoflurane vs. enflurane
    * **Dynamic** (also known as tautomere)  
    The molecule exists in a different molecular structures depending on the environment.
        * e.g. midazolam has pH dependent imidazole ring opening. When the pH is less than 4 the ring remains open, maintaining water solubility. Midazolam is supplied at pH of 3.5, and so is water soluble on injection but (due to its pKa of 6.5) becomes 89% unionised at physiological pH therefore able to cross lipid membranes.


* **Stereoisomers**  
Atoms are connected in the same order in each isomer, but differ in their spatial arrangement (i.e. through rotation). Stereoisomers are **not-superimposable** - the different isomers can't be rotated so that they look the same. Stereoisomers are divided into:
    * **Geometric Isomers**  
    Have a chemical structure (e.g. a carbon-carbon double-bond) prevents free rotation of groups, so different locations of chemical groups will create an isomer. Geometric isomers are known as **cis-** or **trans-** depending on whether the subgroups are on the same or opposite sides (respectively) of the chemical structure.
        * e.g. atracurium
    * **Optical Isomers**  
    Optical isomers are **chiral**. This means they have **no plane of symmetry**. Optical isomers:
        * Were named based on how they rotated under polarised light:
            * **Dextrorotatory**  
            (d- or (+) isomers) molecules rotate **clockwise** under polarised light.
            * **Levorotatory**  
            (l- or (-) isomers) molecules rotate **counter-clockwise** under polarised light.
        * Unfortunately, different molecules were found to rotate in different directions depending on the temperature. Therefore, a different classification scheme (R/S) is also used:
            * Based on chemical structure
            * "Priority" is assigned to each atom in the structure
            * Highest priority is usually those with the highest molecular weight, but other rules exist for ambiguous or very large molecules
            * The molecule is arranged in space such that the lowest priority atom is facing "away"
            * An arrow is then drawn from the highest priority to the lower priority atoms:
                * If this arrow travels **clockwise** it is the **R (Rectus)** isomer
                * If this arrow travels **counter-clockwise** it is the **S (Sinister)** isomer
        * Optical isomers are divided into:
            * **Enantiomers**  
            Possess one chiral centre.
                * e.g. levobupivacaine is less cardiotoxic than racemic bupivacaine.
            * **Diastereoisomers**  
            Possess multiple chiral centres, and may have multiple stereoisomers. Since not all are mirror images, these are not *enantiomers*.
                * For a molecule with *n* chiral centres up to *n<sup>2</sup>* isomers are possible, though some of these may be duplicates.

##Preparations
**Racemic solutions**  
A **racemic** solution is one which where the different enantiomers are present in equal proportions.

**Enantiopure preparations**  
A drug produced with a single isomer, which may be **more effiacious** or **less toxic** (and definitely more expensive) than the racemic preparation.
