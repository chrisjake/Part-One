# Autonomic Nervous System
>Describe the autonomic nervous system, including anatomy, receptors, subtypes and transmitters (including their synthesis, release and fate)

The ANS controls involuntaryand visceral functions. **Central control** occurs in the **hypothalamus**, **brainstem**, and **spinal cord**. Peripherally it is divided anatomically and functionally into the **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** nervous systems.

##Central Control
The hypothalamus controls autonomic functions by neural and endocrine mechanisms. It is subdivided anatomically into four regions:

* **Anterior hypothalamus**  
  Controls the PNS and thermoregulation. It also **releases ADH** in response to increased plasma osmolality, and **oxytocin**.
* **Medial hypothalamus**  
  Inhibits appetite in response to increase in blood glucose.
* **Lateral hypothalamus**  
  Contains the thirst centre and drive to seek food.
* **Posterior hypothalamus**  
  Controls vasomotor centres, modulating sympathetic vasoconstriction, as well as positive and negative inotropy and chronotropy. Also modulates wakefulness in response to sympathetic stimulii.

Signals from the hypothalamus have a tonic output to:
* All smooth muscle
* Heart
* Exocrine organs
* Endocrine organs
* GIT
* GU

##Central Anatomy
In the grey matter of he spinal cord, the efferent nerve synapses with two other nerves connected in series. This maintains the tonic autonomic outflow.

Efferent sympathetic nerves then exit the spinal cord anteriorly to form the **ventral root ganglion**.

Conversely, afferent nerves form the **dorsal root ganglion** before synapsing in the spinal cord.

##Sympathetic Nervous System
Sympathetic supply is from the **sympathetic trunks**, a paired bundle of sympathetic neurons which run lateral to the vertebral bodies from T1 to L2. The trunks are the site of the sympathetic ganglion, and so they have a**short** pre-ganglionic fibre (connecting to the spinal cord), and a long post-ganglionic fibre (connecting to the effect site).

The sympathetic trunks are then subdivided into four parts:
* The **cervical part** innervates the head, neck, and part of the thorax
* The **thoracic part** is from T1-T5 and innervates the aorta, heart, and lungs
* The **lumbar part** forms the coeliac plexus
* The **pelvic part** innervate the pelvic visceral and lower limb vasculature

Post-ganglionic fibres all have **nicotinic ACh** receptors and release **noradrenaline** at the effect site, though the sensitivity (for ACh) and activity (for NA release) is modulated by a number of other substances including enkephalin, neuropeptide Y, dopamine, adrenaline, prostaglandin, GABA, and neurotensin.

###Effect
Sympathetic stimulation has a number of effects by either direct neural innervation or adrenaline release. They are consistent with a 'fight or flight' response, and optimise the body for short-term stress conditions.

|Effector Organ|Sympathetic Innervation|Response|
|--|--|--|
|**Eye**|CN III via the Edinger-Westphal nucleus|Pupillary constriction
|**Bronchial muscle**|Thoracic|Relaxation
|**Heart**|Thoracic|↑ HR, ↑ inotropy, ↑ conduction velocity
|**Vasculature**|Sacral|Constriction
|**MSK**|Sacral|Sweating, contraction, lipolysis
|**GIT**|Thoracic, lumbar|Decreased motility, increased sphincter tone, gluconeogenesis
|**GU**|Pelvic|Detrusor relaxation, sphincter contraction, ↑ uterine tone

* Bronchial smooth muscle relaxation  
  Decrease resistance to respiration
* Inotropy and chronotropy  
  Increase cardiac output
* Peripheral vasculature vasodilatation
* Mydriasis  
  Increases the amount of light entering the eye
* Piloerection and sweating
* Ejaculation

##Parasympathetic Nervous System
Parasympathetic innervation arise from the cranial nerves and from S2-S4. Parasympathetic ganglia sit close to their target organ, so the preganglionic fibre is long, whilst the post-ganglionic fibre is short. The neurotransmitter at the ganglionic synapse and at the effector organ is ACh.

**Cranial parasympathetics** follow CN III, VII, IX, and X. The vagus is the major cranial parasympathetic, and innervates the heart and lungs via the pulmonary and cardiac plexuses, and the stomach, liver, spleen, and pancreas via the gastric plexus.

**Sacral** outflow from S2-4 and forms the hypogastric plexus which innervate the colon, rectum, bladder, and uterus.

###Effect

|Effector Organ|Parasympathetic Innervation|Response|
|--|--|--|
|**CNS**|CN III via the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, CN VII|Pupillary constriction (CN III), lacrimation (CN VII)
|**Bronchial muscle**|CN X|Contraction
|**Heart**|CN X|↓ HR, ↓ inotropy, ↓ conduction velocity
|**Vasculature**|||
|**MSK**|||
|**GIT**|CN VII (submaxillary and mandibular salivary glands), CNIX (parotid gland), CNX (stomach to proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon), hypogastric plexus (distal one-third of the transverse colon to rectum)|Salivation, decreased sphincter tone, increased motility
|**GU**|Hypogastric plexus|Detrusor contraction, erection

##Enteric Plexus
The **enteric plexus** is a system of autonomic nerves in the GIT which is free of CNS control. It consists of sensory and integrative neurons as well as excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons which generate coordinated muscular activity.
