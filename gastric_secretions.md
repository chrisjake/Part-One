# Gastric Secretions {#id}
> Describe the composition, volumes and regulation of gastrointestinal secretions

The GIT produces a a number of substances which can be classified by region and function:
* Saliva
    * H<sub>2</sub>O (98%)
    * Digestive proteins
        * Amylase
        * Lipase
        * Mucin
        * Haptocorrin  
        Binds Vitamin B12.
    * Immunological proteins
        * Lysozyme
        * Lactoferrin
        * IgA


* Gastric
    * Digestive
        * HCl
        * Gastrin
        * Pepsin
        * Intrinsic Factor
    * Mucosal Protection
        * Mucous
        * HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>


* Small Bowel
    * Digestive
        * Pancreatic
            * Lipase
            * Amylase
            * Trypsinogen
        * Endocrine
            * Secretin
            * Somatostatin

##Control of Secretions
Secretion occurs in three phases:
* Cephalic  
  Thought/sight/taste/smell of food, resulting in vagal-mediated stimulus to release gastrin. Accounts for ~30% of production.
* Gastric  
  Stretch of the stomach stimulates HCl secretion and gastrin release. Accounts for ~50% of production.
* Intestinal  
  A drop in pH of the proximal duodenum releases **secretin** to stimulate the exocrine pancreas.

##Salivary Secretions
Approximately **1L** of saliva is produced by the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands each day.

Saliva has four main functions:
* **Lubrication**  
    * Mucin
* **Digestion**  
    * Amylase
    * Lipase  
    Particularly important in neonates who produce little pancreatic lipase.
* **Neutralisation of acid**  
For protection prior to vomiting.
* **Antibacterial**

##Gastric Secretions
The stomach produces **~2L** of secretions **per day**.
###Acid Secretion
**Parietal cells** contain an H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> exchange pump which facilitates acid release in response to increased levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from stimulation by **ACh**, **histamine** (H<sub>2</sub>), or **gastrin**. Secretion is inhibited by low gastric pH and somtostatin.

The supply of H<sup>+</sup> is due to the action of carbonic anhydrase on CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with 'waste' HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removed from the cell in exchange for Cl<sup>-</sup>.

###Gastrin
Gastin is a peptide family secreted from antral **G cells** predominantly in response to neural stimulation in the cephalic phase of digestion. Release is also stimulated by protein and amino acids in the stomach, alcohol, and caffeine. Secretion is inhibited by low pH, secretin, and glucagon. Gastrin has a number of pro-digestive effects:
* Stimulates gastric acid secretion
* Stimulates pancreatic secretion
* Stimulates biliary secretion
* Increases gastric and intestinal motility

###Pepsinogens
**Chief cells** secrete pepsinogen I and is released by ACh or Î² stimulation. It is cleaved to pepsin in the gastric lumen, and breaks down protein.

###Intrinsic Factor
**Parietal cells** produce intrinsic factor, which forms a complex with B<sub>12</sub> which facilitates its later absorption in the terminal ileum.

###Mucous
**Neck cells** produce mucopolysaccharide, glycoprotein, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in response to stimulus by prostaglandins, which protects mucosa and lubricates food.

##Pancreatic Secretions
Exocrine pancreatic secretions are produced by the **acinar** and **ductal cells**, at the rate of **1.5L per day**. Release is stimulated by CCK, secretin, and ACh (via vagal stimulation).

They consist of:
* HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  
 To alkalinise gastric contents
* Water
* Enzymes
    * Trypsinogen   
      Proteolysis
    * Amylase  
      Hydrolysis of glycogen, starch, and complex carbohydrate
    * Lipase  
      Hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides

##Endocrine Function
* Cholecystokinin (**CCK**) is a peptide family secreted by pancreatic **acinar cells** which stimulates the gallbladder, duodenal secretions, and regulate satiety and leptin release from fat.
* Secretin is released by the proximal duodenum in response to low pH, and stimulates pancreatic release.
* Motilin is released **cyclically** from M cells in the small bowel and stimulates the migrating motor complex.
