# Gastric Secretions {#id}
> Describe the composition, volumes and regulation of gastrointestinal secretions

The GIT produces a a number of substances which can be classified by region and function:
* Saliva
    * H<sub>2</sub>O (98%)
    * Digestive proteins
        * Amylase
        * Lipase
        * Mucin
        * Haptocorrin  
        Binds Vitamin B12.
    * Immunological proteins
        * Lysozyme
        * Lactoferrin
        * IgA


* Gastric
    * Digestive
        * HCl
        * Gastrin
        * Pepsin
        * Intrinsic Factor
    * Mucosal Protection
        * Mucous
        * HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>


* Small Bowel
    * Digestive
        * Pancreatic
            * Lipase
            * Amylase
            * Trypsinogen
        * Endocrine
            * Secretin
            * Somatostatin

##Control of Secretions
Secretion occurs in three phases:
* Cephalic  
  Thought/sight/taste/smell of food, resulting in vagal-mediated stimulus to release gastrin. Accounts for ~30% of production.
* Gastric  
  Stretch of the stomach stimulates HCl secretion and gastrin release. Accounts for ~50% of production.
* Intestinal  
  A drop in pH of the proximal duodenum releases **secretin** to stimulate the exocrine pancreas.

##Salivary Secretions
Approximately **1L** of saliva is produced by the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands each day.

Saliva has four main functions:
* **Lubrication**  
    * Mucin
* **Digestion**  
    * Amylase
    * Lipase  
    Particularly important in neonates who produce little pancreatic lipase.
* **Neutralisation of acid**  
For protection prior to vomiting.
* **Antibacterial**

##Gastric Secretions
The stomach produces **~2L** of secretions **per day**:
* **Acid secretion**  
**Parietal cells** contain an H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> exchange pump.
    * H<sup>+</sup> is produced by carbonic anhydrase on CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with 'waste' HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removed from the cell in exchange for Cl<sup>-</sup>.
        * High levels of acid production result in large amounts of bicarbonate being secreted into blood
            * This creates an **alkaline tide** as portal venous pH increases dramatically
            * Respiratory quotient of the stomach may become negative due to **consumption of CO<sub>2</sub>**
    * This pump is activated in response to increased levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from stimulation by:
        * **ACh**
        * **Histamine** (H<sub>2</sub>)
        * **Gastrin**
    * Inhibited by:
        * Low gastric pH
        * Somatostatin


* **Gastric**  
Gastin is a peptide family secreted from antral **G cells**.
    * Secretion is stimulated by:
        * Neural (vagal) stimulation in the cephalic phase of digestion  
        Main mechanism.
        * Protein and amino acids in the stomach
        * Drugs  
            * Alcohol
            * Caffeine
    * Secretion is inhibited by:
        * Low pH
        * Secretin
        * Glucagon
    * Gastrin has a number of pro-digestive effects:
        * Stimulates gastric acid secretion
        * Stimulates pancreatic secretion
        * Stimulates biliary secretion
        * Increases gastric and intestinal motility

* **Pepsinogens**  
**Chief cells** secrete pepsinogen I and is released by ACh or Î² stimulation. Pepsinogen is cleaved to pepsin in the gastric lumen, and breaks down protein.

* **Intrinsic Factor**  
**Parietal cells** produce intrinsic factor, which forms a complex with B<sub>12</sub> which facilitates its later absorption in the terminal ileum.

* **Mucous**  
**Neck cells** produce mucopolysaccharide, glycoprotein, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in response to stimulus by prostaglandins, which protects mucosa and lubricates food.

* **Pancreatic Secretions**  
Exocrine pancreatic secretions are produced by the **acinar** and **ductal cells**, at the rate of **1.5L per day**.
    * Release is stimulated by:
        * CCK
        * Secretin
        * ACh  
        Via vagal stimulation.
    * Consist of:
        * HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  
         To alkalinise gastric contents.
             * Pancreatic bicarbonate production lowers venous pH, and neutralise's the alkaline tide of the stomach.
        * Water
        * Enzymes
            * Trypsinogen   
              Proteolysis.
            * Amylase  
              Hydrolysis of glycogen, starch, and complex carbohydrate.
            * Lipase  
              Hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides.

##Endocrine Function
* Cholecystokinin (**CCK**) is a peptide family secreted by intestinal enteroendocrine cells (I cells) in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. Cholecystokinin:
    * Regulates satiety
    * Regulates leptin release from fat
    * Stimulates secretions from the gallbladder and duodenum 
* Secretin stimulates pancreatic release. Secretin is:
    * Released by the proximal duodenum in response to low pH
* Motilin stimulates the migrating motor complex. Motilin is:
    * Released **cyclically** from M cells in the small bowel
