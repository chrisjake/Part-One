#Variations in Blood Pressure
> Describe the physiological factors that may contribute to pulse variations in blood pressure

Blood pressure is not uniform throughout the circulation. Ventricular ejection generates two waves:
* A blood flow wave  
Travels at **~20cm.s<sup>-1</sup>**.
* An arterial pressure wave  
Distends the elastic walls of the large arteries during systole. Travels at **4m.s<sup>-1</sup>**.
