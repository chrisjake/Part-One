#Variations in Blood Pressure
> Describe the physiological factors that may contribute to pulse variations in blood pressure

Blood pressure is not uniform throughout the circulation. Ventricular ejection generates two waves:
* A blood flow wave  
Travels at **~20cm.s<sup>-1</sup>**.
* An arterial pressure wave  
Distends the elastic walls of the large arteries during systole, which then recoil during diastole to facilitate continual blood flow. This is the **Windkessel effect**.
    * This wave travels at **4m.s<sup>-1</sup>**
    * This is what is felt when pulses are palpated
    
##Changes by Site of Measurement
Measured pressure changes predictably at more distal sites:
* All gradients are increased  
Arterial upstroke and falloff are both steeper.
* The SBP increases
* DBP decreases
* **MAP is constant**
* The dicrotic notch occurs later and becomes less sharp  
This occurs due to reflections in arterial pressure waves.

##Physiological Changes
Changes in circulatory function:
* **Inotropy**  
The rate of systolic upstroke is related to $$\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$$, and therefore contractility.
* **SVR**  
The gradient between the peak systolic pressure and the dicrotic notch gives an indiciation of SVR. E.g., a steep downstroke suggests a low SVR, as the pressure in the circulation rapidly falls when ejection ceases.
* **Preload**  
A beat-to-beat variation is seen with the respiratory cycle, due to the change in preload occurring with changes in intrathoracic pressure.

##Pathological Changes
* **Aortic Stenosis**  
Causes a reduction in:
    * Pulse pressure  
    Due to reduced stroke volume.
    * Gradient of upstroke  
    Due to reduced stroke volume and reduced velocity of ejection.
* **Aortic Regurgitation**  
    * Wide pulse pressure  
    Combination of:
        * Increased SBP due to the increased force of ejection due to increased preload (Starlings Law), which occurs due to high ESV
        * Decreased DBP due to part of the stroke volume flowing back into the ventricle through the incompetent valve
