# Dead Space

Dead space is the proportion of minute ventilation which does not participate in gas exchange.

##Types of Dead Space
Dead space can be divided into:
* **Apparatus dead space**  
Dead space from equipment, such as tubes ventilator circuitry. Some apparatus dead space may actually *reduce* total dead space, as an ETT bypasses the majority of anatomical dead space of the patient (nasopharynx).


* **Physiological dead space**  
  Dead space from the patient. Physiological dead space may be measured with **Bohr's method**. Physiological dead space is divided into:
  * **Anatomical dead space**  
  The volume of the conducting zone of the lung. Anatomical dead space may be measured by **Fowlers method**. Anatomical dead space is affected by:
    * Size and Age  
    3.3ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> in the infant, falls to 2.2ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> in the adult
    * Posture  
      Decreases when supine.
    * Position of the neck and jaw  
      Increased with neck extension.
    * Lung volumes  
      Increases by ~20ml per litre of additional lung volume.
    * Airway calibre  
    Bronchodilation increases airway diameter and therefore V<sub>D</sub>.

  * **Pathological/Alveolar Dead Space**    
    Dead space caused by disease. Pathological dead space may be calculated by substracting physiological dead space (Bohr's Method) from anatomical (Fowler's method).
    * Causes of pathological dead space include:
      * Decreased pulmonary artery pressure  
        * Hypovolaemia
        * RV failure/Increased RV afterload:
          * High intrathoracic pressures (e.g. PPV)
          * PE
          * HPV
          * MI
      * Increased alveolar pressure
        * PEEP
        * Positioning


##Calculation of Dead Space
###Fowler's Method
Anatomical dead space is measured using Fowler's Method. This is a **single-breath nitrogen washout test**, which calculates **anatomical dead space** and **closing capacity.

* At the end of a normal tidal breath (at FRC) a vital-capacity breath of 100% oxygen is taken
* The patient the exhales to RV  
Expired nitrogen and volume is measured
* A plot of expired nitrogen concentration by volume is generated, producing a graph with four phases:
  * Phase 1  
  Gas from the anatomical dead space is expired. This contains 100% oxygen - no nitrogen is present.
  * Phase 2  
  A mix of anatomical dead space and alveolar (lung units with short time constants) is expired. The midpoint of phase 2 is the volume of the **anatomical dead space**.
  * Phase 3  
  Expired nitrogen reaches a plateau as just alveolar gas is exhaled (lung units with variable time constants).
  * Phase 4  
  Sudden increase in nitrogen concentration, which signals the **closing capacity**. This occurs because:
    * Basal alveoli are more compliant than apical alveoli
    * Therefore, in inspiration basal alveoli inflate more than apical alveoli
    * The single 100% oxygen breath therefore preferentially inflates the basal alveoli
    * In expiration, the process is reversed:
        * Basal alveoli preferentially exhale
        * At closing capacity, small basal airways close and now only apical alveoli (with a higher concentration of nitrogen) can exhale
        * Expired nitrogen concentration increases

###Bohr's Method
Physiological dead space is measured using Bohr's method. This calculates dead space as a ratio, or proportion of tidal volume:

$$ {V_D \over V_T} = {V_T - V_A \over V_T}$$

The Bohr equation is a method of calculating the $$V_D \over V_T $$ ratio. It is based on the principle that **all CO<sub>2</sub> exhaled must come from ventilated alveoli**.

$${V_D \over V_T} = {PA_{CO_2} - P{\bar{E}_{CO_2}} \over PA_{CO_2}}$$

Note that:
* $$P{\bar{E}_{CO_2}}$$ is the mixed-expire carbon dioxide
* That this requires measuring alveolar PCO<sub>2</sub>  
As this is impractical, the **Enghoff modification** is typically used. This assumes that PACO<sub>2</sub> â‰ˆ PaCO<sub>2</sub>. The equation then becomes:

$${V_D \over V_T} = {Pa_{CO_2} - P{\bar{E}_{CO_2}} \over Pa_{CO_2}}$$

A **normal** value for physiological dead space during normal tidal breathing is 0.2-0.35.

##Physiological Consequences of Increased Dead Space
In dead space, the V/Q ratio approaches infinity and alveolar ventilation falls. This results in a rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>, which stimulates the respiratory centre to increase minute ventilation to return alveolar ventilation (and therefore CO<sub>2</sub>) to normal.

There is no effect on PaO<sub>2</sub>, as all blood is heading to other alveoli.

###Relationship between Alveolar Ventilation and PaCO<sub>2</sub>
Atmospheric air contains negligible CO<sub>2</sub>. As MV increases, PaCO<sub>2</sub> will fall, as will the gradient for further CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion. Therefore:

$$PaCO_2 \propto {1 \over \dot{V}_A}$$

##Footnotes
Note that West Zone 1 (where PA > Pa > Pv) physiology is increased dead space.

The PaCO<sub>2</sub>-ETCO<sub>2</sub> difference is a consequence of dead space, as dead space gas dilutes alveolar gas.
