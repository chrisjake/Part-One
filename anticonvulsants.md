# Anticonvulsants

In **general**, anticonvulsants are:
- Well absorbed orally
- Highly protein bound
- Hepatically metabolised by CYP450 enzymes, and induce their own metabolism (as well as that of other drugs)
- Renally eliminated
- Interact with each other


|Property|Phenytoin|Sodium Valproate|Carbamazepine
|--|--|
|**Uses**|GTCS, partial seizures, trigeminal neuralgia, ventricular arrhythmias|Partial seizures|Antiepileptic, trigeminal neuralgia
|**Presentation**|Capsules, syrup, solution. IV formulation incompatible with dextrose.|Tablets, syrup, solution|Tablets, suppositories, syrup|
|**Route of Administration**|PO, IV, IM|PO, IV|PO|
|**Dosing**|15-20mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> load, aiming plasma levels 10-20mcg.ml<sup>-1</sup>|300-1250mg BD|50-800mg BD|
|**Mechanism of Action**|Stabilises Na<sup>+</sup> channels in their inactive state, inhibiting generation of further action potentials. |Stabilises Na<sup>+</sup> channels in their inactive state and GABAergic inhibition|Stabilises Na<sup>+</sup> channels in their inactive state and potentiates GABA|
|**Absorption**|PO bioavailability 90%|PO bioavailability 100%|95% PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|Highly protein bound|Highly protein bound|Highly protein bound
|**Metabolism**| Hepatic metabolism with highly individual variation in dosing. Obeys first-order kinetics in the therapeutic range, and **zero-order kinetics just above the therapeutic range**. Metabolised by **CYP450**. Induces warfarin, benzodiazepines, OCP metabolism. Inhibited by metronidazole, chloramphenicol, isoniazid.|Hepatic to inactive and active metabolites|Hepatic
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of inactive metabolites and active drug|Renal elimination of metabolites and active drug|Renal elimination
|**CVS**|↓ BP & heart block with rapid administration, antiarrythmic properties||Antiarrhythmic|
|**CNS**|↑ Seizure threshold, paraesthesia, ataxis, nystagmus|↑ Seizure threshold|↑ Seizure threshold|
|**Renal**|||Water retention from ADH-like effects|
|**Haeme**|Aplastic anaemia||Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (requires regular testing)
|**Immune**|Rash|||
|**Metabolic**||Hyperammonaemia|||
|**Other**|Requires monitoring due to narrow therapeutic window and significant pharmacokinetic variation. Teratogenic.||Reduces efficacy of aminosteroids
