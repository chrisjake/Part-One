# Endocrine Functions of the Kidney
>Outline the endocrine functions of the kidney

The kidney is involved in a number of endocrine processes and produces or metabolises a number of hormones:
* RAAS
* Vitamin D
* EPO
* Prostaglandins

##Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
The RAAS is a signaling pathway involved in blood pressure control. It involves a number of hormones:

* **Angiotensinogen** is produced by the liver in response to:
     * Glucocorticoids
     * Thyroid hormones
     * Oestrogens
     * Angiotensin II
     * Various inflammatory proteins


* **Renin** is a protease produced by the kidneys in response to Î²<sub>1</sub> stimulation or hypotension, and exists to **cleave angiotensinogen** to **angiotensin I**.

* **ACE** cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and also cleaves bradykinin into inactive metabolites.


* **Angiotensin II** increases blood pressure via a number of mechanisms:
    * Simulates **aldosterone release** from the renal cortex, increasing sodium and water retention
    * **Vasoconstriction of afferent and efferent arterioles**, reducing renal blood flow and GFR
    * **Reduces K<sub>f</sub>** through constriction of glomerular mesangial cells
    * Increased SNS activity and **central and peripheral vasoconstriction**
    * **Increases thirst** via hypothalamic stimulation
    * Stimulates **ADH release**, reducing renal water excretion
    * Stimulates release of angiotensinogen

##Vitamin D
Vitamin D has a complex metabolic pathway which meanders through a number of organ systems:
* Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may be absorbed in diet or produced in skin by the action of UV light on 7-dehydrocholesterol
* Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is then hydrolysed in the liver by CYP450 enzymes to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD<sub>3</sub>)
* 25-OHD<sub>3</sub> is then converted in the proximal tubule to calcitriol - the active form

##Erythropoietin
Erythropoiesis is stimulated by hypoxia, haemorrhage, and low haematocrit, and inhibited by high red cell volume. These adjustments are mediated by erthropoietin.

In adults, 85% of EPO comes from interstital cells in the perihilar capillaries of the kidneys (with the remainder from the liver). The production of EPO is decreased in renal failure, which is why patients with ESRD require exogenous EPO.
