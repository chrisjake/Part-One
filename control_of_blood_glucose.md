# Control of Blood Glucose
>Explain the control of blood glucose

Normal blood glucose in the non-diabetic is 4-6 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>, though will rise after consumption of carbohydrate. Glucose regulation can be divided into:
* Short-term  
Regulation via secretion or inhibition of insulin and glucagon from the pancreatic islets. * Long-term  
Regulation via both neuronal (SNS activation) and hormonal (cortisol, GH) mechanisms.

##Hormal Mechanisms
###Short Term
Glucose levels are sensed directly in the pancreas and will result in insulin release when the **BGL is >5.6** mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>. A transient glycosuria may be seen as hyperglycaemia decreases renal absorption of glucose.

**Pancreatic B cells** respond directly to glucose by secreting insulin in a biphasic fashion:
* An initial, rapid increase in release
* A prolonged, slow increase in release


**Glucose enters** via the GLUT-2 transporter, and is converted to pyruvate which enters **the citric acid cycle**. **ATP** is produced, which **inhibits** ATP-sensitive **K<sup>+</sup> channels**, reducing K<sup>+</sup> efflux and **causing depolarisation**. Depolarisation causes **Ca<sup>2+</sup> release**, resulting in **exocytosis** of insulin granules. This is responsible for the **initial** insulin release.

Glutamate is produced as a by-product of the citric acid cycle, and results in maturation of other granules. Release of these granules is responsible for the second phase of insulin release.

Conversely, a low glucose level stimulates secretion of glucagon. This is typically less important than the effect of insulin unless in situations of starvation or severe physiological stress.

The effects of insulin and glucagon on the liver cause a continual adjustment of the relative rates of glycolysis and glycogenesis, allowing it to function as an effective **buffer** of **blood glucose**. Hepatic disease significantly limits the efficacy of this system, and results in a widely-fluctuating blood glucose level.

###Long Term
Sustained hypoglycaemia stimulates **growth hormone** and **cortisol** release, which **decreases glucose utilisation** and **increases fat utilisation**, limiting further reduction in blood glucose.

##Neuronal Mechanisms
**Hypoglycaemia** has a direct **stimulatory** effect on the **hypothalamus**, resulting in increased **sympathetic** nervous system activity. This results in **adrenaline** release, which will in turn stimulate hepatic **glucose release**.

##Physiological Responses to Hypoglycaemia

|BSL (mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>) |Symptoms|Endocrine Response|
|--|--|--|
|4.6||Insulin secretion inhibited|
|3.8|Autonomic dysfunction|Glucagon, adrenaline, and GH secretion|
|2.8|CNS dysfunction||
|2.2|Lethargy, Coma||
|1.7|Convulsions||
|0.6|Permanent brain damage, Death|||
