# Tocolytics

Tocolytics are agents which decrease uterine tone. Tocolytics include:
* β<sub>2</sub>-agonists
* Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel antagonists
* COX Inhibitors
* MgSO<sub>4</sub>
* Nitrates
* Volatile anaesthetic agents

All tocolytics are discussed in more detail elsewhere - this covers just the mechanism of action of their uterine effects.

|Drug|β<sub>2</sub>-agonists|Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel antagonists|COX Inhibitors|
|--|--|
|**Example**|Salbutamol|Nifedipine|Indomethacin
|**Mechanism of Action**|Activate GPCR, ↑ cAMP causing a ↓ in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and relaxation|Block L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, causing relaxation|Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which are vital for uterine contraction
