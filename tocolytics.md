# Tocolytics

Tocolytics are agents which decrease uterine tone. Tocolytics include:
* [β<sub>2</sub>-agonists](beta_agonists.md)
* [Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel antagonists](calcium_channel_blockers.md)
* [COX Inhibitors](cox_inhibitors.md)
* MgSO<sub>4</sub>
* Nitrates
* Volatile anaesthetic agents

All tocolytics are discussed in more detail elsewhere - this covers just the mechanism of action of their uterine effects.

|Drug|β<sub>2</sub>-agonists|Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel antagonists|COX Inhibitors|
|--|--|
|**Example**|Salbutamol, Terbutaline|Nifedipine|Indomethacin
|**Mechanism of Action**|Activate GPCR, ↑ cAMP, which activiates protein kinase A and leads to inhibition of myosin light chain kinase and relaxation|Block L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, causing relaxation|Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which are vital for uterine contraction
