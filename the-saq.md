#The SAQ

A good response to a short-answer question is constructed from two things:
* **Structure**  
Developing a structured approach to answering SAQs is essential to succeeding in this section of the exam. A structured approach:
    * Lets you organise your thoughts, and is easily digested by the examiner
    * Allows you to recall more information than you would otherwise  
Especially if you learnt it **in the same format**. This is important for pharmacology.
    * Typically lends itself to bullet points rather than paragraphs
* **Knowledge**  
Obviously.

Additionally, a good response will:
* **Answer the question**  
This is stated *repeatedly* in examiner reports. If the question asks for a discussion of the respiratory changes of pregnancy, no marks will be awarded for cardiovascular changes.
* **Be legible**
* **Not be perfect**  
This is often-overlooked. The examiner reports (and some model answers), assume a perfect, 10/10, response by the candidate. Not only is this not feasible given the time allowed, it is also not expected - remember that **the pass mark is 50%**.

    A good response will cover the major points in reasonable detail, and will generally focus on principles rather than specifics. Marks become progressively harder to acquire

##Answering the Question
* You have exactly **10 minutes** per SAQ
* You should practice to **7-8 minutes** per SAQ  
In many cases, the last question (or questions) goes unanswered. This demonstrates poor time management, as easy marks were thrown away by candidates reaching for harder marks on earlier questions.

* For each question, you should:
    * Decide what part of the curriculum it is assessing
    * Work out the context, if any
    * Decide what structure would be most appropriate
