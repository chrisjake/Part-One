# Anaerobic Metabolism


##Ketones
β-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver produces acetyl CoA, which usually enters the citric acid cycle and produces ATP. When large amounts of acetyl CoA are produced, they may instead condense to form **acetoacetate**, which can then be reduced to **β-hydroxybutyrate**. These substances are known as ketones.

Ketones can only be produced by the liver, and only used as a substrate by the kidney, as well as skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Production of ketones is accelerated by glucagon and adrenaline.
