#Breathing Systems
*This provides a general overview of anaesthetic breathing systems. The circle system in particular is covered [elsewhere](/circle-system.md).*

Classifications:
* Open  
Anaesthetic gases not confined to the circuit.
	* Limited current practical application  
	Expensive, environmental contamination.
	* e.g. Ether masks
* Non-rebreathing  
No expired gas is re-inspired; requires a one-way valve.
	* Limited practical application
	* Requires a low-resistance draw-over vaporiser
	* e.g. Triservice apparatus
		* Robust
		* Inexpensive
* Rebreathing systems  
Expired gas is re-inspired.
	* Absorption systems  
	Requires method for CO<sub>2</sub> absorption.
		* Circle  
		Common anaesthetic circuit, covered in detail under. Can be:
			* Vaporiser Out-of-Circuit  
			Common system, covered in detail under [circle system](/circle-system.md).
				* $$[Alv_{agent}] \propto {FGF \over MV}$$
			* Vaporiser in-circuit  
			Uncommon system.
				* $$[Alv_{agent}] \propto {MV \over FGF}$$  
				* In a spontaneous ventilation mode, the patient will increase agent concentration as minute ventilation ↑
				This means that as surgical stimulus ↑, depth of anaesthesia also ↑.
		* Waters  
		Mapleson B or C with a CO<sub>2</sub> absorption canister between bag and FGF.
	* Non-absorption
	Rebreathing expired gas is part of circuit design.
		* Mapleson Systems

##Mapleson System
Properties:
* Rebreathing of expired gas **does not necessarily equate to CO<sub>2</sub> retention**, provided the FGF is above a certain multiple (circuit dependent) of the patients MV
	* PaCO<sub>2</sub> is a function of FGF and CO<sub>2</sub> production **only**  
	Increasing MV without increasing FGF will result in rebreathing of CO<sub>2</sub> and unchanged PaCO<sub>2</sub>.
* In any spontaneous ventilation mode, patients will hyperventilate if FGF is inadequate

Types:
* Mapleson A
	* Setup
		* APL valve close to mask
		* Tubing between bag and mask
		* FGF close to bag
	* Flow requirements  
		* Spontaneous ventilation: $$~0.7 \times MV$$  
		APL valve is set low. Initial exhalation (which is mostly **dead space**, and not containing CO<sub>2</sub>) will fill bag until bag pressure exceeds APL valve opening pressure. Provided the APL valve is set *low*, the majority of CO<sub>2</sub> containing exhalation will exit through the APL valve, and FGF required to clear CO<sub>2</sub> from the circuit is low.
		* Controlled ventilation:  $$~>3 \times MV$$  
		APL valve is set high. More of the exhalation will fill the bag, and so a greater FGF is required to prevent rebreathing.
* Mapleson B & C
	* Setup  
	APL valve and FGF are situated close to the mask.  
		* Mapleson B has long tubing between the mask and bag
		* Mapleson C has short tubing between the mask and bag
	* Flow requirements  
	Spontaneous and controlled ventilation are similar, at $$~3 \times MV$$.
* Mapleson D
	* Setup
		* FGF is is close to mask
		* Valve is close to bag
		* Tubing between FGF and APL valve  
		Co-axial versions exist, but are functionally similar.
	* Flow requirements  
	Overall, generally the best circuit to maximise efficiency across both spontaneous and controlled ventilation.
		* Spontaneous ventilation: $$~2 \times MV$$
		* Controlled ventilation: $$~0.8-1 \times MV$$  
		Best circuit for controlled ventilation.
* Mapleson E/Ayre's T-piece
	* Setup
		* T-shaped circuit with no valve or bag
* Mapleson F/Jackson-Rees modification to the Ayre's T-piece
	* Setup
		* Bag (with hole) added to the stem of the T of a Mapleson E  
		Allows monitoring of ventilation, and occluding the hole of the bag allows controlled ventilation.
		* Functionally identical to a Mapleson D, with an operator-controlled APL valve
	* Flow requirements  
	As per Mapleson D.
		* Spontaneous ventilation: $$~2 \times MV$$
		* Controlled ventilation: $$~0.8-1 \times MV$$
