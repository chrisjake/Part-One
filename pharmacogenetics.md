(eg malignant hyperpyrexia, porphyria, atypical cholinesterase and disturbance of cytochrome function).


##Genetic variability
A **genetic polymorphism** is where several functionally distinct genes exist within a population. This is common, and may affect an individuals susceptibility to adverse drug reactions.

Understanding of genetic variability is a goal of **personalised medicine**, where drugs can be selected based on an understanding of what will be efficacious and tolerable.

It is also the cause of some adverse drug reactions.

##Pharmacogenetic disorders
###Pseudocholinesterase  
A condition where plasma cholinesterase is unable to breakdown suxamethonium, prolonging its duration of action. This mutation:
* Has four alleles
  * Usual
  * Atypical (dibucaine-resistant)
  * Silent (absent)
  * Fluorie-resistance
* May be congenital or acquired
  * Congenital is autosomal recessive
    * Homozygotes: Prolonged paralysis
    * Heterozygotes: Slightly prolonged paralysis
  * Acquired is due to a loss of plasma cholinesterase
    * Pregnancy
    * Organ failure
      * Hepatic
      * Renal
      * Cardiac
    * Malnutrition
    * Hyperthyroidism
    * Burns
    * Malignancy
    * Drugs
      * OCP
      * Ketamine
      * Lignocaine and ester local anaesthetics
      * Metoclopramide
      * Lithium
      
###G6PD  
A common x-linked recessive condition that may cause haemolysis following administration of oxidative drugs including: aspirin, sulfonamides, and some antibiotics.

###Malignant Hyperthermia  
Autosomal dominant deficiency in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene resulting in a defect of intracellular calcium regulation. This mutation:
* Causes massive calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in the presence of volatile anaesthetic agents (and potentially suxamethonium)  
Leads to:
  * Increased muscle activity
  * Rapid increase in body temperature and lactic acidosis
  * High mortality from hyperthermia, hyperkalaemia/rhabdomyolysis, leading to ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest
* Mutationresent in 1:5,000 - 1:50,000
* Presents with:
  * Initially:
    * Tachycardia
    * Masseter spasm
    * Hypercapnoea
    * Arrythmia
  * Intermediate:
    * Hyperthermia
    * Sweating
    * Combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis
    * Hyperkalaemia
    * Muscle rigidity
  * Late:
    * Rhabdomyolysis
      * Myoglobinuria
      * Elevated CK
    * Coagulopathy
    * Cardiac arrest
* Management consists of:
  * Cease administration of volatile
    * Start TIVA
  * Give **dantrolene**
    * 1mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> increments up to 10mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>
    * 20mg vials reconstituted with 60ml sterile water
      * 3g mannitol as additive
      * Highly alkaline  
      Damaging if extravasation occurs.
  * Treat complications:
    * Hyperkalaemia
    * Hyperthermia
    * Acidosis
    * Arrhythmias
    * Renal failure

###Porphyria
Autosomal dominant deficiency in the first step of haeme synthesis. These mutations:
* Result in a partial deficiency of enzymes
* Lead to accumultion of porphyrin precursors
* May be precipitated by many drugs:
  * Ketmine
  * Clonidine
  * Ketorolac
  * Diclofenac
  * Phenytoin
  * Erythromycin
  * Barbiturates
