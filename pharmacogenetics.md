(eg malignant hyperpyrexia, porphyria, atypical cholinesterase and disturbance of cytochrome function).


##Genetic variability
A **genetic polymorphism** is where several functionally distinct genes exist within a population. This is common, and may affect an individuals susceptibility to adverse drug reactions.

Understanding of genetic variability is a goal of **personalised medicine**, where drugs can be selected based on an understanding of what will be efficacious and tolerable.

It is also the cause of some adverse drug reactions.

##Pharmacogenetic disorders
###Pseudocholinesterase  
An autosomal recessive trait where plasma cholinesterase is unable to breakdown suxamethonium, prolonging its duration of action  


###G6PD  
A common x-linked recessive condition that may cause haemolysis following administration of oxidative drugs including: aspirin, sulfonamides, and some antibiotics.

###Malignant Hyperthermia  
Autosomal dominant deficiency in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene resulting in a defect of intracellular calcium regulation, which causes massive calcium release in the presence of suxamethonium or volatile anaesthetic agents. Increased muscle activity causes rapid increase in body temperature and lactic acidosis.

It is managed with IV dantrolene in 1mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> increments up to 10mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> and aggressive cooling.

###Porphyria
