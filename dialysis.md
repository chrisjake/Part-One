# Dialysis
Dialysis is the **separation of particles in a liquid based on their ability to pass through a membrane**. 

##Indications
Failure of normal renal functions, i.e.:
* **A**cid
* **E**lectrolyte derangement  
Particularly hyperkalaemia
* **I**ntoxications
* **O**verload
* **U**reamia

##Physical Mechanisms
Fluid and electrolytes can be removed by four different mechanisms:
* **Diffusion**  
Diffusion is the **spontaneous movement of substances from a higher concentration to a lower concentration**, where rate of movement is proportional to the concentration gradient (as per Fick's Law).

 
 
* **Ultrafiltration**  
Movement of water, as determined by Starling's Forces.
  * When a solvent passes through a membrane, the process is called osmosis. The frictional forces between solutes and water molecules will pull dissolved substances along, a process known as bulk flow or **solvent drag**.

##Implementation
* **Haemodialysis**  
Uses diffusion.  
  * Blood is pumped through an extracorporeal circuit that contains a dialyser.
  * Dialysate flow is countercurrent, which maximises the gradient for diffusion.
  * Solutes move across a membrane between blood and dialysate, as per Fick's Law:
    * Concentration gradient between blood and dialysate
      * Flow rate of blood and dialysate
    * Solubility of the solute
      * Mass
      * Charge
      * Protein binding
    * Dialysis membrane permeability
      * Thickness
      * Porosity
      * Surface area


* **Haemofiltration**  
Uses ultrafiltration.
  * Both a positive hydrostatic pressure in blood and a negative hydrostatic pressure in dialysate is generated, causing ultrafiltration and removal of solutes via solvent drag.
  * Elimination via bulk flow is **independent of solute concentration gradients across the membrane**.
  * Transport is dependent on Starling Forces:
    * The transmembrane pressure generated
      * Blood flow to the membrane
      * Oncotic pressure gradient
    * Porosity of the membrane
  * Additionally, a high filtration fraction will cause excessive haemoconcentration, and clotting of the filter
  * The filtered fluid (ultrafiltrate) is discarded, and replaced with another fluid depending on the desired fluid balance.

###Differences
* Renal Replacement Therapy (RTT) can be via:
   * Peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   * Intermittent haemodialysis (IHD)  
   * Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)
     * Continuous Veno-Venous Haemofiltration (CVVH)
     * Continuous Veno-Venous Haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)

* IHD causes greater cardiovascular instability compared to CRRT as the fluid and electrolyte shifts occur more rapidly.

* Small molecules (<500 Da) ad electrolytes can be removed by filtration or dialysis
* Medium-sized molecules (500-5000 Da) are best removed by filtration
* Low molecular weight proteins (5000-50000 Da) are removed by filtration  
This includes removal of inflammatory proteins and may be benficial in sepsis.
* Water is best removed by filtration

##Pharmacokinetics of RRT
Pharmacokinetics are unpredictable, but are broadly affected by:
* **Free drug in plasma**  
Drugs with a small proportion of free drug in plasma are (unsuprisingly) poorly removed by RRT. These include:
  * Highly protein bound substances
  * Drugs with a V<sub>D</sub> greater than 1L.kg<sup>-1</sup>
* **Size**  
Small molecules (<500 Da) are more easily cleared by diffusive methods of RTT.
* **Dose/Flow rates**  
Reduced flow rates will reduce clearance.
* **Membrane permeability**  
* **Residual renal function**  
Patients residual GFR will also affect pharmacokinetics.
* **Timing**  
Drugs given between IHD or SLED sessions will not be cleared until the next session.s
