Inhaled anaesthetics are chemicals with general anaesthetic properties that can be delivered by inhalation. They can be divided into:
* **Volatile** anaesthetic agents  
Volatility refers to the tendency of a liquid to vaporise. Volatile agents include:
    * Sevoflurane
    * Isoflurane
    * Desflurane
    * Methoxyflurane
    * Enflurane
    * Halothane
* Anaesthetic gases
    * Nitrous oxide
    * Xenon
    
##Pharmacokinetics
Key principles:
* A **partition coefficient** describes the **relative affinity** of an agent for two phases  
The partition coefficient is **defined** as the **ratio of the concentration** of agent in each phase when the **partial pressures are in equilibrium**.
    * The **blood-gas partition coefficient** describes the solubility of the agent in blood relative to air  
    A **high** blood-gas partition coefficient: 
        * Indicates an agent is more soluble in blood
        * Leads to a greater uptake of agent into the pulmonary circulation and therefore a **reduction in P<sub>A</sub>**  
        The fall in P<sub>A</sub> **prolongs** both **induction** and **recovery**.
            * This might feel counterintuitive, but think of it like this:
                * If the agent is highly soluble in blood, a lot of the delivered agent will be soaked up in blood, where it has no effect
                * Conversely, if the agent is poorly soluble in blood, then the blood 'compartment' will be saturated quickly, and the agent will instead dissolve into the CNS    
    
* The **clinical effect** of an inhalational agent **is dependent on** its **partial pressure** within the CNS
* **At equilibrium**, the partial pressure in the CNS (**P<sub>B</sub>**) **equals** the partial pressure in blood (**P<sub>a</sub>**), and in the alveoli (**P<sub>A</sub>**)  
Reaching equilibrium is rarely achieved in practice as it takes many hours.
* Rate of onset and offset of an inhalational agent are dependent on both physiological and pharmacological factors affecting the transfer of agent:
    * Into the alveoli
    * From the alveoli into blood
    * From blood into the CNS

Increasing P<sub>A</sub> will increase the pressure gradient for diffusion into blood, and therefore CNS. P<sub>A</sub> is dependent on:
* **Alveolar concentration of agent**  
    * Inspired concentration  
    A high inspired concentration (*F*<sub>i</sub>) will increase the rate of increase of alveolar concentration (*F*<sub>A</sub>. Inspired concentration is dependent on:
        * Fresh gas flow  
        **Increasing FGF** (and the concentration of agent in the added gas) *F*<sub>i</sub>.
        * Volume of the breathing system  
        A **lower circuit volume** will increase the rate at which the patient reaches equilibrium with the circuit, and therefore **increase *F*<sub>i</sub>**.
        * Circuit absorption  
        **Absorption of agent** by the circuit will **decrease *F*<sub>i</sub>**.
    * V<sub>A</sub>  
    Increased alveolar ventilation increases *F*<sub>i</sub>, as it replenishes agent that has been taken up into the vasculature.
    * FRC  
    A **large FRC** will dilute the amount of agent inspired with each breath, and so **reduce *F*<sub>i</sub>**.

* **Drug uptake from the lungs**  
    * Blood-gas partition coefficient  
    A **high** blood-gas partition coefficient **prolongs** both induction and recovery. The blood-gas coefficient is affected by:
        * Temperature
        * Haematocrit  
        Variable effect, which depends on the particular agents affinity for red cells or plasma (and serum constituents, e.g. albumin).
            * An agent that is less soluble in red cells (e.g. isoflurane) will have a decreased blood-gas partition coefficient in anaemia.
    * Alveolar blood flow  
    Increased alveolar blood flow increases uptake and delivery to tissues, including the CNS. However, the increased uptake causes a reduction in P<sub>A</sub>. Therfore, **rate of onset** is **reduced** when **alveolar blood flow** is **high**. Alveolar blood flow is a function of:
        * Cardiac output  
        * Shunt
    * Alveolar-Venous partial pressure gradient  
    The difference in partial pressure of agent in the alveolus and venous blood is due to the uptake of drug in tissues. Tissue uptake is dependent on:
        * Tissue blood flow  
        As the CNS has a high blood flow, it will equilibrate more quickly.
        * Blood:tissue solubility coefficients
            * Muscle has a similar affinity as blood, but equilibrates more slowly than the CNS due to lower blood flow
            * Fat has a much higher affinity for anaesthetic than muscle, but equilibrates very slowly due to the very low blood flow  
            This has a greater effect in obese people, especially during prolonged anaesthesia, as they have a longer equilibration time and therefore prolonged emergence.
    * Second gas effect  
    Use of nitrous oxide with another agent will increase the P<sub>A</sub> of that agent.
    
###Alteration to Pharmacokinetics in Children and the Elderly
Increased rate of induction in children due to:
* Increased V<sub>A</sub>/FRC ratio  
Increases P<sub>A</sub>.
* Lower albumin and cholesterol  
Reduced blood-gas solubility coefficients.
    
Increased rate of induction in elderly due to:
* Lower MAC requirement
* Lower albumin


##Mechanism of Action of Inhaled Anaesthetic Agents
Mechanisms of action can be divided into:
* **Macroscopic**  
At the level of the brain and spinal cord.
    * In the spine by:
        * Decreasing transmission of noxious afferent signals at the thalamus
        * Inhibition of spinal efferents, decreasing motor responses
    * In the brain by:
        * Global depression of CBF and glucose metabolism
* **Microscopic**  
Synapses and axons by:
    * Inhibiting pre-synaptic excitatory activity:
        * ACh
        * 5-HT
        * Glutamine
    * Augmenting post-synaptic inhibitory activity:
        * GABA<sub>A</sub>
* **Molecular**  
Anaesthetic agents may alter the function of molecules within the CNS. These include:
    * Alteration of α-subunits of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor  
    This prolongs the time it spends open once activated, prolonging the inhibitory Cl<sup>-</sup> current and increasing the degree of hyperpolarisation.
    * Enhance the activity of two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channels  
    Increases the resting membrane potential of both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic CNS neurons.

##Pharmacodynamics of Inhaled Anaesthetic Agents

###Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC)
MAC is **defined** as the minimum alveolar concentration at **steady state** which prevents a movement response to a standard surgical stimulus (midline incision) in 50% of a population. Note that this definition:
* Does not reflect lack of awareness  
Reflects the action of an agent on spinal cord reflexes.
* Consciousness is better estimated by MAC-awake  
End-tidal concentration of agent that prevents appropriate responses to a verbal command in 50% of a population.
    * Note that this technically measures *awareness* rather than memory.
    * **MAC-awake** is typically **one-third** of **MAC**
* Is only valid at **sea-level**  
The **clinical effect** of an agent is **dependent** on its **partial pressure *not* **concentration**.
    * At 1atm, these are almost the same  
    1atm ≃ 100kPa; therefore 2% sevoflurane is ≃ 2kPa
    * As altitude increases, the actual partial pressure will fall for any given concentration  
    i.e. 2% sevoflurane at 0.5atm is ≃ 1kPa of sevoflurane.
MAC is:
* A measure of potency
