#Local Anaesthetics
> Understanding of the pharmacology of local anaesthetic drugs, including their toxicity

Local anaesthetic drugs create a use-dependent temporary blockade of neuronal transmission by blocking the voltage-gated sodium channel in the cell membrane, preventing depolarisation. 

All local anaesthetics consist of:
* A hydrophilic component
* A lipophilic aromatic ring
* An amide or ester link connecting the two

##Mechanism of Action
Action is dependent on blockade of the sodium channel. Two theories exist:
* **Unionised** drug **passes through the cell membrane**, and then becomes **ionised intracellularly**
* The ionised drug is then able to bind to the **open **sodium channel, and prevent conduction of sodium and therefore generation of an action potential
  * This theory explains use-dependent blockade, as sodium channels can only be blocked in their open state
* An alternative suggested mechanism of action is the drug enters the cell membrane and mechanically distorts the channel, rendering it ineffective

##Key Characteristics of Local Anaethetics
Characteristics are related to chemical structure. These include:
* **Potency**  
Potency is a function of **lipid solubility** and vasodilator properties.
* **Duration of action**  
Highly **protein bound** agents have an increased duration of action.
* **Onset**  
Speed of onset is related to **pK<sub>a</sub>** and **dose**.
  * Agents with a low pK<sub>a</sub> are less ionised at physiological pH (remember **b**ases are ionised **b**elow their pK<sub>a</sub>), and therefore have a faster onset of action.
    * This is also why anaesthetics are ineffective in anaesthetising infected tissue, as the low pH makes the majority of the LA ionised and unable to cross the cell membrane.
  * Increasing the dose increases the speed of onset, as per Fick's Law
* **Vasodilator activity**  
In general, drugs cause vasodilation in low concentrations, and vasoconstriction at high concentrations (though there are exceptions, e.g. cocaine).

##Toxicity
Local anaesthetics are:
* Toxic to both the **CNS** and **CVS**
* Toxicity occurs when there is an excess plasma concentration  
This occurs when the rate of drug entering the systemic circulation is greater than the drug leaving the systemic circulation due to redistribution and metabolism.

Toxicity is related to the:
* **Drug factors**
  * **Drug used**  
Agents are compared using the **CC/CNS ratio**:
    * This is the ratio of the dose of drug required to cause cardiovascular collapse (CC) compared to the dose required to cause seizure (a crude alternative to the therapeutic index)
  * **Dose used**  
Continuous infusions are more likely to cause a delayed onset of local anaesthetic toxicity.


* **Block factors**
  * **Type of block**
    * **Site** of administration  
    This affects the rate of uptake into the systemic circulation, and the likelihood of inadvertent intravascular injection. Ranked (from highest to lowest):
      * Intravascular (obviously)  
    This is the most common cause of LA toxicity.
        * Site is also relevant here: an injection into the carotid artery will cause toxicity at a lower dose than if injected into a peripheral vein.
      * Intercostal
      * Caudal
      * Epidural
      * Brachial plexus
      * Subcutaneous
  * Use of **adjuncts**
  * Adrenaline  
    Vasoconstrictor properties reduce systemic absorption of LA.
  * **Technique**  
    * Frequent aspiration
    * Test dose
    * Use of ultrasound


* **Patient factors**  
Anything that increases peak [plasma] can lead to an increased risk of LA toxicity.
  * Blood flow to affected area
  * α1-acid glycoprotein  
  Low levels of this protein increase free drug fraction.  
    * Neonates and infants have half the level of AAG than adults.
  * Hepatic disease  
  Reduces clearance of amides, which may cause toxicity with repeated doses or use of infusions.
  * Age  
  Organ blood flow (and therefore clearance), as well as pharmacokinetic interactions may affect clearance of LA. Both **children and the elderly** have **reduced clearance** of LA.
  * Acidosis  
  Increases unionised portion.

###Cardiac Toxicity
Cardiac toxicity occurs due to:
* Blocking of the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel (K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may also be involved)  
Severity of toxicity will vary depending on how long the agent binds to the channel, with **less toxicity** caused by agents spending **less time bound**:
  * Lignocaine  
  Spends the shortest time bound to the channel, so causes the least amount of toxicity. This is also why lignocaine can be used as an antiarrhythmic, but other agents can not.
  * Buipivacaine  
  Takes **10x as long** to dissociate as lignocaine. This can lead to re-entrant arrhythmias, and then VF. The **risk **of this is **increased in tachycardia**, as it potentiates use-dependent blockade.
  * Ropivacaine  
  Dissociates more rapidly from cardiac channels than bupivacaine.
* Direct myocardial depressant effects  
Reduces cAMP levels by disrupting metabotropic receptors.

**Cardiac **toxicity is **triphasic**:
* Initial phase
  * Hypertension
  * Tachycardia
* Intermediate phase:
  * Hypotension
  * Myocardial depression
* Terminal phase:
  * Severe hypotension
  * Vasodilation
  * Various arrhythmias  
    * Sinus bradycardia
    * Variable degree heart block
    * VT
    * VF
    * Asystole

###CNS Toxicity
Local anaesthetics in their unionised state can cross the BBB and interfere with CNS conduction. **CNS toxicty is biphasic**:
* Initally, inhibitory interneurones are blocked  
This causes excitatory effects:
  * Perioral tingling
  * Slurred speech
  * Visual disturbances
  * Tremulousness
  * Dizziness
  * Confusion
  * Convulsions  
  Typically signifies the end of the excitatory phase.
* Secondly, there is a general depression of all CNS neurons  
This causes inhibitory effects:
  * Coma
  * Apnoea
  
* CNS toxicity is potentiated by other CNS depressants, and hypercarbia
  
###Treatment
Toxicity is managed with an **ABC approach**, though definitive management uses **intralipid emulsion**:
* Intralipid is an emulsion of soya oil, glycerol, and egg phospholipids.  
Mechanism of action in uncertain, but theories include:
  * Lipid sink  
  ILE binds unionised LA, causing it to distribute off receptor sites.
  * Fatty acid metabolism  
  Cardiac fatty acid metabolism is interrupted by LA. ILE provides a source of fatty acids to allow metabolism to continue.
  * Competitive antagonism  
  ILE may directly inhibit LA binding.
  
  
* Dosing:
    * Give Intralipid 20% 1.5ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> over 1 minute
      * Followed by an infusion at 0.25ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>


* Complications include **pancreatitis**  
Note that ILE interferes with amylase and lipase assays, and so these will be unreliable.
    
Note that whilst propfol can be used to treat seizures, the amount of lipid contained in propofol is inadequate to bind LA.

##Common Features of Local Anaesthetics
|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Amide (-NHCO-) or Ester (-CCO-)
|**Pharmaceutics**|Amides are stable in solution, esters are unstable in solution. All are formulated as a hydrochloride salt to ensure water solubility.
|**pKa**|All are weak bases, and have a pKa > 7.4
|**Onset**|Onset is related to dose (Fick's Law) and pKa, with a **low pKa** giving a **faster onset** as there is more unionised drug present and therefore more drug able to cross the cell membrane. This is why local anaesthetics are poor at anaesthetising infected tissues, as the tissue pH is low resulting in a greater proportion of ionised drug, and less drug reaching the effect site.
|**Duration of Action**|Duration of action is related to protein binding, with **greater protein binding** giving a **longer duration of action**
|**Potency**|Potency is related to lipid solubility (**higher lipid solubility increases potency**) and vasodilator properties (**weaker vasodilators having greater potency**)
|**Absorption**|Systemic absorption **varies with site of entry** (from highest absorption to lowest: IV, intercostal, caudal epidural, lumbar epidural, brachial plexus, subcutaneous), **dose**, and **presence of vasoconstrictors**
|**Distribution**|Amides are extensively protein bound, esters are minimally bound
|**Metabolism**|Amides are hepatically metabolised, esters are hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterases (giving a much shorter t<sub>1/2</sub>)
|**CVS**|Vasodilatation at low concentrations, vasoconstriction at high concentrations. Inhibition of cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channels, inhibiting maximum rate of rise of phase 0 of the cardiac action potential. Negative inotropy proportional to potency
|**CNS**|Does-dependent CNS effects: circumoral tingling, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremors, dizziness, slurred speech, convulsions, coma, apnoea. Potentiated by other CNS depressants and hypercarbia (due to ↑CBF and ↓ seizure threshold).
|**Toxic Effects**|Esters have a higher incidence of **allergy**. Local anaesthetic toxicity is predominantly CNS and CVS. Toxicity is compared using the **CC/CNS ratio** - the ratio  of the dose of drug required to cause cardiovascular collapse (CC) compared to the dose required to cause seizure - a crude alternative to the therapeutic index as a tool to classify safety of local anaesthetic agents. Toxicity is treated with intralipid 20% 1.5ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> over 1 minute, followed by infusion at 0.25ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>.
