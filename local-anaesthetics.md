#Local Anaesthetics
> Understanding of the pharmacology of local anaesthetic drugs, including their toxicity

Local anaesthetic drugs create a use-dependent temporary blockade of neuronal transmission by blocking the voltage-gated sodium channel in the cell membrane, preventing depolarisation. 

All local anaesthetics are weak bases consisting of:
* A hydrophilic component
* A lipophilic aromatic ring
* An amide or ester link connecting the two

##Mechanism of Action
Action is dependent on blockade of the sodium channel. Two theories exist:
* **Unionised** drug **passes through the cell membrane**, and then becomes **ionised intracellularly**
* The ionised drug is then able to bind to the **open **sodium channel, and prevent conduction of sodium and therefore generation of an action potential
  * Local anaesthetics also display reduced affinity for K<sup>+</sup> and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels
  * This theory explains use-dependent blockade, as sodium channels can only be blocked in their open state
* An alternative suggested mechanism of action is the drug enters the cell membrane and mechanically distorts the channel, rendering it ineffective
* Onset is inversely proportional to the size of the fibre  
From fastest to slowest:
  * Pain
  * Temperature
  * Touch
  * Deep pressure
  * Motor


##Key Characteristics of Local Anaethetics
Characteristics are related to chemical structure. These include:
* **Potency**  
  * Potency is expressed with the minimum effective concentration of local anaesthetic (C<sub>m</sub>)  
  This is the concentration of LA that results in complete block of a nerve fibre in 50% of subjects in standard conditions. More potent agents have a lower C<sub>m</sub>.
  * Potency is a function of:
    * Lipid solubility  
    Potency (and also toxicity) increases with greater lipid solubility.
    * Vasodilator properties  
    In general, local anaesthetics cause vasodilation in low concentrations, and vasoconstriction at high concentrations (except cocaine, which causes vasoconstriction at all concentrations).
* **Duration of action**  
Duration of action is a function of:
  * Drug factors
    * Vasodilator properties  
    Vasoconstriction increases the duration of block.
    * Use of additives  
    Addition of adrenaline to lignocaine increases duration of block.
    * Lipid solubility  
    Increased lipid solubility increases duration of action, as agent remains in the nerve for longer.
      * Potency therefore has a positive correlation with duration of action
      * Duration of action is increased when pH increases, as the ionised portion falls.  
    * Protein binding  
    Highly protein bound agents have an increased duration of action.
      * Protein binding decreases with decreasing pH, increasing the fraction of unbound drug  
      This is why agents such as bupivacaine are more cardiotoxic in acidotic patients.
      * Local anaesthetics are predominantly bound to α-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG)  
      AAG is reduced in pregancy, increasing the free drug fraction and therefore reducing the toxic dose of LA in pregnant patients.
  * Patient factors
    * Tissue pH  
    Decreased duration of block when tissue pH is low.
    * Metabolic impairment
      * Hepatic failure increases duration of action of aminosteroids
      * Butylcholinesterase deficiency increases duration of ester local anaesthetics
    * Site of administration
    Well vascularised tissue (e.g. intercostal area) will have greater systemic uptake of drug than vessel poor tissue.
* **Onset**  
Speed of onset is related to:
  * Drug factors
    * Dose  
    Increasing the dose increases the speed of onset, as per Fick's Law.
      * Increased concentration will increase speed of onset and block density
      * Increased volume (without increasing dose, resulting in decreased concentration) will decrease speed of onset
    * Lipid solubility  
    An increased lipid solubility increases the speed at which the local anaesthetic enters the nerve. **However**:
      * Lipid solubility also correlates with potency
      * Therefore, **in practice**, more lipid soluble agents are administered in lower doses, and so have a **reduced speed of onset**  
      This is known as Bowman's Principle.
    * Ionised portion  
    Only unionised drug can cross cell membranes. Ionisation is a function of:
      * pKa
      * Tissue pH
        * This is also why anaesthetics are ineffective in anaesthetising infected tissue, as the low pH makes the majority of the LA ionised and unable to cross the cell membrane.
  * Patient factors
    * Nerve activity  
    Local anaesthetics produce a **frequency dependent blockade**. Therefore:
      * Nerves firing frequently will be blocked more easily than quiescent nerves
    * Nerve fibre size  
    Larger nerves require an increased concentration of local anaesthetic to achieve blockade than smaller nerves.
    * Hyperkalaemia  
    Reduces onset of action.
  
##Toxicity
Local anaesthetics are:
* Toxic to both the **CNS** and **CVS**
* Toxicity occurs when there is an excess plasma concentration  
This occurs when the rate of drug entering the systemic circulation is greater than the drug leaving the systemic circulation due to redistribution and metabolism.

Toxicity is related to the:
* **Drug factors**
  * **Drug used**  
Agents are compared using the **CC/CNS ratio**:
    * This is the ratio of the dose of drug required to cause cardiovascular collapse (CC) compared to the dose required to cause seizure (a crude alternative to the therapeutic index)
  * **Dose used**  
Continuous infusions are more likely to cause a delayed onset of local anaesthetic toxicity.


* **Block factors**
  * **Site** of administration  
  This affects the rate of uptake into the systemic circulation, and the likelihood of inadvertent intravascular injection. Ranked (from highest to lowest):
    * Intravascular (obviously)  
    This is the most common cause of LA toxicity.
      * Site is also relevant here: an injection into the carotid artery will cause toxicity at a lower dose than if injected into a peripheral vein.
    * Intercostal
    * Caudal
    * Epidural
    * Brachial plexus
    * Subcutaneous
  * Use of **adjuncts**
    * Adrenaline  
    Vasoconstrictor properties reduce systemic absorption of LA.
  * **Technique**  
    * Frequent aspiration
    * Test dose
    * Use of ultrasound


* **Patient factors**  
Anything that increases peak [plasma] can lead to an increased risk of LA toxicity.
  * Blood flow to affected area
  * α1-acid glycoprotein  
  Low levels of this protein increase free drug fraction.  
    * Neonates and infants have half the level of AAG than adults.
  * Hepatic disease  
  Reduces clearance of amides, which may cause toxicity with repeated doses or use of infusions.
  * Age  
  Organ blood flow (and therefore clearance), as well as pharmacokinetic interactions may affect clearance of LA. Both **children and the elderly** have **reduced clearance** of LA.
  * Acidosis  
  Increases unionised portion.
  * Hypercarbia  
  Increases cerebral blood flow.

###Cardiac Toxicity
Cardiac toxicity occurs due to:
* Blocking of the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel (K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may also be involved)  
Severity of toxicity will vary depending on how long the agent binds to the channel, with **less toxicity** caused by agents spending **less time bound**:
  * Lignocaine  
  Spends the shortest time bound to the channel, so causes the least amount of toxicity. This is also why lignocaine can be used as an antiarrhythmic, but other agents can not.
  * Buipivacaine  
  Takes **10x as long** to dissociate as lignocaine. This can lead to re-entrant arrhythmias, and then VF. The **risk **of this is **increased in tachycardia**, as it potentiates use-dependent blockade.
  * Ropivacaine  
  Dissociates more rapidly from cardiac channels than bupivacaine.
* Direct myocardial depressant effects  
Reduces cAMP levels by disrupting metabotropic receptors.

**Cardiac **toxicity is **triphasic**:
* Initial phase
  * Hypertension
  * Tachycardia
* Intermediate phase:
  * Hypotension
  * Myocardial depression
* Terminal phase:
  * Severe hypotension
  * Vasodilation
  * Various arrhythmias  
    * Sinus bradycardia
    * Variable degree heart block
    * VT
    * VF
    * Asystole

###CNS Toxicity
Local anaesthetics in their unionised state can cross the BBB and interfere with CNS conduction. **CNS toxicty is biphasic**:
* Initally, inhibitory interneurones are blocked  
This causes excitatory effects:
  * Perioral tingling
  * Slurred speech
  * Visual disturbances
  * Tremulousness
  * Dizziness
  * Confusion
  * Convulsions  
  Typically signifies the end of the excitatory phase.
* Secondly, there is a general depression of all CNS neurons  
This causes inhibitory effects:
  * Coma
  * Apnoea
    
###Treatment
Toxicity is managed with an **ABC approach**, though definitive management uses **intralipid emulsion**:
* Intralipid is an emulsion of soya oil, glycerol, and egg phospholipids.  
Mechanism of action in uncertain, but theories include:
  * Lipid sink  
  ILE binds unionised LA, causing it to distribute off receptor sites.
  * Fatty acid metabolism  
  Cardiac fatty acid metabolism is interrupted by LA. ILE provides a source of fatty acids to allow metabolism to continue.
  * Competitive antagonism  
  ILE may directly inhibit LA binding.
  
  
* Dosing:
    * Give Intralipid 20% 1.5ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> over 1 minute
      * Followed by an infusion at 0.25ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>


* Complications include **pancreatitis**  
Note that ILE interferes with amylase and lipase assays, and so these will be unreliable.
    
Note that whilst propfol can be used to treat seizures, the amount of lipid contained in propofol is inadequate to bind LA.
