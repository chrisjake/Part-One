# Centrally Acting Anti-Hypertensives {#id}

|Property|Clonidine|Methyldopa
|--|--|
|**Class**|Central α<sub>2</sub>-agonist (200:1 α<sub>2</sub>:α<sub>1</sub>)|Phenylalanine derivative|
|**Uses**| Analgesia, sedation, anti-hypertensive|Antihypertensive (especially in pregnancy)
|**Presentation**| Clear colourless solution at 150μg.ml<sup>-1</sup>|Tablets - not appropriate for urgent blood pressure reduction|
|**Route of Administration**| PO/IV at 10-200mcg up to QID. Can be added to neuraxial blockade at 1-2mcg.kg<sup>-1</sup> to decrease opioid requirement.|PO/IV.
|**Dosing**| 50-200μg QID.|250-500mg PO BD/TDS.
|**Absorption**|100% PO bioavailability with rapid absorption|Highly variable PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|20% bound, V<sub>D</sub> 2L.kg<sup>-1</sup>|50% protein bound, V<sub>D</sub> 0.3L.kg<sup>-1</sup>
|**Metabolism**|50% hepatic to inactive metabolites, t<sub>1/2</sub>β 9-18 hours|Intestinal and hepatic
|**Elimination**|50% renal elimination unchanged|40% renal elimination unchanged
|**Mechanism of Action**|Agonist of central α2 receptor, ↓ SNS tone via decreased NA release from peripheral nerve terminals.| Metabolised to α-methyl-noradrenaline in the CNS, which agonises central α2 receptors.
|**CVS**|Initial ↑ in BP due to α<sub>1</sub> stimulation, evident with bolus dosing. Followed by prolonged ↓ in BP, ↑ PR, ↓ AV conduction, ↑ baroreceptor sensitisation (lower HR for a given increase in BP). Cessation may cause rebound HTN.|↓ SVR with unchanged HR or CO
|**CNS**| Sedation, analgesia due to ↓ NA release which ↓ opioid requirement. Adjunct in chronic pain and in opioid withdrawal. Anxiolysis at low doses. Central antiemetic effect.|May ↓ MAC
|**Metabolic**|Stress response to surgical stimulus is inhibited||
|**Renal**| Diuresis secondary to inhibition of ADH||
