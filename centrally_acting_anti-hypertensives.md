# Centrally Acting Anti-Hypertensives {#id}

|Property|Clonidine
|--|--|
|**Class**|Central α<sub>2</sub>-agonist
|**Uses**| Analgesia, sedation, anti-hypertensive
|**Presentation**| Clear colourless solution at 150μg.ml<sup>-1</sup>
|**Route of Administration**| PO/IV at 10-200mcg up to QID. Can be added to neuraxial blockade at 1-2mcg.kg<sup>-1</sup> to decrease opioid requirement.
|**Dosing**| 50-200μg QID
|**Absorption**|100% PO bioavailability with rapid absorption
|**Distribution**|20% bound, V<sub>D</sub> 2L.kg<sup>-1</sup>
|**Metabolism**|50% hepatic to inactive metabolites
|**Elimination**|50% renal elimination unchanged
|**CVS**|Initial ↑ in BP due to α<sub>1</sub> stimulation, evident with bolus dosing. Followed by prolonged ↓ in BP, ↑ PR, ↓ AV conduction, ↑ baroreceptor sensitisation (lower HR for a given increase in BP). Cessation may cause rebound HTN.
|**CNS**| Sedation, analgesia due to ↓ NA release which ↓ opioid requirement. Adjunct in chronic pain and in opioid withdrawal. Anxiolysis at low doses. Central antiemetic effect.
|**Metabolic**|Stress response to surgical stimulus is inhibited
|**Renal**| Diuresis secondary to inhibition of ADH
