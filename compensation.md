#Compensation
> Explain the principles underlying acid-base chemistry

##Metabolic Acidosis
Compensation to metabolic acidosis includes:
* Buffering  
Occurs over minutes to hours. Includes:
    * ECF buffers
        * Bicarbonate
        * Plasma proteins
            * Albumin
    * ICF buffers
        * Include phosphate, proteins
        * Leads to hyperkalaemia due to H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> exchange  
        K<sup>+</sup> increases by 0.6mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> per 0.1 unit fall in pH.
    * Bone  
    Exchange of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in bone.  
        * Leads to demineralisation and release of alkaline compounds
* Respiratory compensation  
Occurs in minutes.
    * Rapid response
    * Cannot compensate completely
* Renal compensation  
Occurs over days to weeks. Includes:
    * Elimination of H<sup>+</sup> bound to filtered buffers
        * Include ammonium, phosphate
    * Reabsorption of bicarbonate
    * Active secretion of H<sup>+</sup> in the DCT/CT  
    Under control of aldosterone.
