#Principles of Acid-Base Physiology {#id}
> Explain the principles underlying acid-base chemistry

There have been several different theories of acid-base chemistry. The one most relevant for Brønsted–Lowry definition**, which defines:
* An **acid** as a **proton donor**
* A **base** as a **proton acceptor**

##pH
pH:
* Stands for the **power of hydrogen**
* Is a measure of **hydrogen ion activity** in a solution
 * Activity can be approximated by concentration
  * Therefore, pH can be expressed as a function of hydrogen ion concentration:  $$pH = -log_{10}[H^+]$$
  
##Systemic Effects
pH disturbance affects many organ systems:
* **Respiratory**
 * Increased $$\dot{V}_A$$  
 Peripheral and central chemoreceptors increase ventilation in response to a fall in pH.
 * Oxyhaemoglobin-Dissociation Curve  
 Right-shifted by a fall in pH.
 * Bronchoconstriction  
 Hypercapnoea causes parasympathetically-mediated bronchoconstriction.
* **Cardiovascular**
 * Inotropy  
  Inotropy falls in acidosis due to a direct myocardial depressant effect. May be offset by increased SNS tone in low-grade acidosis. Alkalosis may increase inotropy by increasing responsiveness to circulating catecholamines.
 * Arrhythmias  
 Secondary to altered SNS tone and electrolytes.
 * Vasodilation  
 Directly due to hypercapnoea.
* **CNS**  
H<sup>+</sup> ions cannot cross the BBB, however CO<sub>2</sub> can.
* **Fluid and Electrolyte**  
 * Plasma **K<sup>+</sup> increases **by** 0.6mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> for every 0.1 unit fall** in **pH**  
 This is due to impairment of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
 * **H<sup>+</sup> ions bind **to the **same site on albumin as calcium**, so ionised calcium will **increase**
* **MSK**
 * Bones  
 Chronic metabolic acidosis consumes bone phosphate to buffer H<sup>+</sup> ions, causing osteoporosis.
* **Cellular**
 * Enzyme function  
 Denaturation and functional impairment.
 * Molecular ionisation  
 Change in ionisation may change a molecules ability to cross cell membranes (e.g. reducing dose of thiopentone in acidosis), or affect their function
 * Resting membrane potential  
 Change in ion permeability will alter RMP, and therefore how easy it is to generate an action potential.
 
###Change with Temperature
pH is temperature dependant:
* **pH increases** by **0.015** for every **1°C fall** in **temperature**
* **Gas solubility **almost always** increases** when **temperature falls**  
Dissolving is typically (not always) an **exothermic** reaction. As the kinetic energy content of a molecule falls, its ability to dissociate from solution decreases.
 * As CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves, PaCO<sub>2</sub> falls
 
As blood gas machines operate at 37°C, a measurement error will occur if a patient is not close to 37°C:
* A **hypothermic** patient will have a **higher pH** and **CO<sub>2</sub>** than measured

There are two common methods for **managing** pH of significantly hypothermic patients (e.g., those on CPB): **pH-stat** and **alpha-stat**.
####pH-stat
* CO<sub>2</sub> is added to the circuit so that pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub> are normal when corrected for temperature
* This theoretically improves oxygen delivery by preventing the left-shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve
* The increased CO<sub>2</sub> also causes cerebral vasodilation and may cause an increased risk of cerebral embolic events

####alpha-stat
* pH and CO<sub>2</sub> values are allowed to drift, instead being maintained at 'normal for 37°C'
 * Though they will be higher than this
* Unlike pH-stat, this does not cause cerebral vasodilation
