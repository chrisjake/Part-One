#Principles of Acid-Base Physiology {#id}
> Explain the principles underlying acid-base chemistry

There have been several different theories of acid-base chemistry. The one most relevant for Brønsted–Lowry definition**, which defines:
* An **acid** as a **proton donor**
* A **base** as a **proton acceptor**

##pH
pH:
* Stands for the **power of hydrogen**
* Is a measure of **hydrogen ion activity** in a solution
 * Activity can be approximated by concentration
  * Therefore, pH can be expressed as a function of hydrogen ion concentration:  $$pH = -log_{10}[H^+]$$
  
##Systemic Effects
pH disturbance effects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as cellular function:
* **Respiratory**
 * Increased $$\dot{V}_A$$  
 Peripheral and central chemoreceptors increase ventilation in response to a fall in pH.
 * Oxyhaemoglobin-Dissociation Curve  
 Right-shifted by a fall in pH.
