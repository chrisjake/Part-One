# Direct Vasodilators

Direct vasodilators include Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (covered in anti-arrhythmics), nitrates such as GTN and SNP, and hydralazine.

Both GTN and SNP increase production of NO. This inhibits guanylate cyclase, increasing cGMP. This inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into smooth muscle and enhances its sequestration into smooth endoplasmic reticulum, causing a drop in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and subsequent vasodilation.

|**Class**|Inorganic Nitrate|Organic Nitrate|Direct vasodilator
|**Uses**|Afterload reduction|Afterload reduction, angina|HTN
|**Presentation**|Solution at 10mg.ml<sup>-1</sup>, must be protected from light|Spray, tablets, patch, IV solution which is absorbed into PVC - requires a polyethylene administration set|20mg ampoule or powder. Should not be reconstituted with dextrose.
|**Route of Administration**| IV only| IV, topical, sublingual| PO, IV
|**Dosing**|0.5-6µg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>|10-200µg.min<sup>-1</sup>|5-20mg IV|
|**Absorption**||<5% PO bioavailability|30% bioavailability due to high first pass metabolism
|**Metabolism**|Reacts with Oxy-Hb in RBC to form NO, CN, and MetHb. MetHb reacts with CN to form cyanomethaemoglobin. CN is metabolised in the liver and kidney to form SCN, the majority of which is excreted in urine (though may be re-converted to CN). CN may also be combined with hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) to form cyanocobalamin, which is eliminated in urine.|GTN is a prodrug which is metabolised to NO and glycerol dinitrate (which is then also converted to NO) in the liver.|N-acetylated in gut and liver
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of SCN and cyanocobalamin. Impaired in renal failure which may worsen CN toxicity. t<sub>1/2</sub> for SCN is 2-7 days|t0.5 1-4mins. Urinary excretion|Dependent on acetylation rates

##Nitrate Toxicity
CN toxicity causes a metabolic acidosis with an ↑CvO<sub>2</sub>, and occurs when free CN binds to cytochrome oxidase and prevents aerobic metabolism. This is treated by: stopping the SNP infusion, giving hydroxycobalamin to chelate CN, and nitrites to induce methaemoglobinaemia (which binds CN more avidly than regular Hb) giving sodium thosulfate (promotes conversion to SCN)
