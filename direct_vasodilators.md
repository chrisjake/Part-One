# Direct Vasodilators

Direct vasodilators include Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (covered in anti-arrhythmics), nitrates such as GTN and SNP, and hydralazine.

Both GTN and SNP increase production of NO. This inhibits guanylate cyclase, increasing cGMP. This inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into smooth muscle and enhances its sequestration into smooth endoplasmic reticulum, causing a drop in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and subsequent vasodilation.

CN is metabolised in the liver and kidney to form SCN, the majority of which is excreted in urine (though may be re-converted to CN). <br><br> CN may also combine with hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) to form cyanocobalamin, which is eliminated in urine.|Prodrug.

##Nitrate Toxicity
Nitrate toxicity can be related to:
* Cyanide
* Thiocyanate
* Methaemoglobinaemia

###Cyanide Toxicity
Cyanide toxicity occurs only with SNP, as CN<sup>-</sup> is produced as a byproduct of metabolism.
* **Kinetics**
        * Rapid cellular uptake
        * Small V<sub>D</sub>
        * Hepatically metabolised to **thiocyanate**, using thiosulfate as a substrate
* **Mechanism**  
CN<sup>-</sup> binds to cytochrome oxidase, preventing oxidative phosphorylation causing histotoxic hypoxia characterised by:
        * Rapid loss of consciousness and seizures if inhaled
        * Metabolic acidosis
        * Lactataemia
        * Arrhythmia
        * Increased MVO<sub>2</sub>
        * Hypertension  
        Due to acute tachyphylaxis to SNP.
    * Cyanide has a
    * Risk of cyanide toxicity from SNP is related to:
        * Infusion rate
        * Infusion duration
* **Management**
        * Supportive care, including inotropes
        * Cyanide chelators  
        Bind CN<sup></sup>, removing it from the circulation. Include:
                * Dicobalt edetate  
                * Hydroxycobalamin (Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>)
        * Sulfur donors*  
        Provide additional sulfhydryl groups, allowing further hepatic metabolism of CN<sup>-</sup> to SCN. Include:
                * **Thiosulfate**
        * Nitrites  
        Converts Oxy-Hb to Met-Hb, which has a higher affinity for CN<sup>-</sup> than cytochrome oxidase. Include:
                * Sodium nitrite
                * Amyl nitrite
                
###Thiocyanate Toxicity
Thiocyante is produced with hepatic metabolism of CN<sup>-</sup>. Toxicity occurs when thiocyanate accumulates, which occurs in:
* Long duration SNP infusions  
7-14 days.
* Patients with renal failure  
Reduced clearance, may occur in 3-6 days.
* Patients given thiosulfate for management of CN<sup>-</sup> toxicity.

* **Effects**  
Multisystemic, including:
        * Rash
        * Abdominal pain
        * Weakness
        * CNS disturbance


* **Treatment**  
        * Dialysis

###Methaemoglobinaemia
Methaemoglobinaemia occurs when the Fe<sup>2+</sup> (ferrous) ion in haemoglobin is oxidised to the Fe<sup>3+</sup> (ferric) form, which is **unable** to **bind oxygen**.
