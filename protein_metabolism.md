##Metabolism

Protein **catabolism** involves the **deamination** of amino acids. Deamination can occur in one of two ways:
* **Oxidative deamination**  
Hepatic deamination, removing the amino group to create a ketoacid and ammonia. Ammonia produced in the liver[^1] enters the urea cycle and becomes urea, which requires **3 ATP**.
* **Transamination**  
Amino group is transferred by aminotransferases to another amino acid or a ketoacid to produce a new aminoacid. **Essential amino acids** cannot be produced by transamination - they must be supplied in the diet.


separating them into:
* Keto acids, which:
    * Enter the citric acid cycle and produce ATP
    * Get converted to glucose or fatty acids
* Amino groups
    * Enter the urea cycle and become urea

[^1]: Ammonia can also be produced in the kidney by the deamination of glutamate in the kidney. In this instance it is eliminated directly in urine as ammonia (or ammonium) and does not consume ATP.
