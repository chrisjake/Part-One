# The Placenta
> Outline the functions of the placenta, and determinants of placental blood flow.

The placenta is an organ of maternal and foetal origin which supports the developing foetus.

##Physiological Properties
The placenta has three broad functions:
* Interface between foetus and mother for nutrient exchange
* Immunological barrier
* Endocrine

###Nutrient and Waste Exchange Functions
The primary purpose of the placenta is **diffusion of nutrients and oxygen**, and **removal of waste**.

As with the lung, diffusion is dependent on Ficks Principle, i.e.:

$$\dot{V} = {A \times D \times \Delta P \over T }$$, where:  
* $$\dot{V}$$ = Flow of substance across the membrane
* $$A$$ = Area of the membrane
* $$D$$ = Diffusion constant for the substance, where $$ D \propto {Lipid \ Solubility \over \sqrt{Molecular \ Weight}} $$
* $$\Delta P$$ = Pressure difference across the membrane
* $$T$$ = Thickness of the membrane

Maternal placental flow is ~600mL.min<sup>-1</sup> at term - double that of foetal flow - which improves diffusion by increasing the concentration gradient for solutes.

Molecules < 600 Da in size more readily diffuse down concentration gradients.



####O<sub>2</sub> Diffusion
At the end of pregnancy, **PO<sub>2</sub> for foetal blood**:
* Entering the placenta via the uterine artery is **18mmHg** (SpO2 45%)  
* Leaving the placenta via uterine vein is **28mmHg** (SpO2 70%)

The foetus is able to absorb a large enough volume of O<sub>2</sub> despite the low PO<sub>2</sub> for three reasons:
* **Foetal Hb**  
Contains **two gamma subunits** instead of beta subunits. These prevent the binding of 2,3-DPG, which result in a **left-shifted Oxy-Haemoglobin dissociation curve**, favouring oxygen loading at a low PaO<sub>2</sub>.

* Foetal [Hb] is 50% greater than maternal [Hb]
 

* The **Double Bohr** effect:  
The Bohr effect states that an **increase** in **PaCO<sub>2</sub>** **right-shifts** the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. Conversely, the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> increases in alkalaemia. The double Bohr effect describes this happening in opposite directions in the foetal and maternal circulations, favouring transfer of O<sub>2</sub> to the foetus:
    * In the placenta, foetal CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into maternal blood down its concentration gradient  
    This makes **foetal blood relatively alkaline, and maternal blood relatively acidic**. Therefore:
      * O<sub>2</sub> unloading of maternal blood is favoured
      * O<sub>2</sub> loading of foetal blood is favoured

####CO<sub>2</sub> Diffusion
CO<sub>2</sub> is extremely lipid soluble, and so passes easily across membranes. Foetal PaCO<sub>2</sub> is ~50mmHg, and intervillous PCO<sub>2</sub> is ~37mmHg. CO<sub>2</sub> offloading is favoured in the foetus by:
* A high Foetal [Hb] increases the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be carried as carbaminohaemoglobin
* The **Double Haldane** effect:  
The Haldane effect states that deoxygenated Hb binds CO<sub>2</sub> with more affinity than oxygenated Hb. The double Haldane effect describes this happening in opposite directions in the maternal and foetal circulations, favouring CO<sub>2</sub> transfer to the mother:
    * As maternal blood releases O<sub>2</sub>, this favours maternal loading of CO<sub>2</sub> without an increase in maternal PCO<sub>2</sub> (Haldane effect).
    * The release of CO<sub>2</sub> from the foetal Hb favours O<sub>2</sub> loading, which in turn favours further maternal O<sub>2</sub> release.

####Nutrient Diffusion
In late pregnancy, foetal caloric requirements are high (approximately the same as the mother). **Facilitated diffusion** of **glucose** via carrier molecules occurs in trophoblasts.

Active transport occurs for amino acids, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe, folate, and vitamins A and C. Other transporters actively remove substances from foetal circulation.

###Immunological Function
The placenta is selectively **permeable to IgG** via pinocytosis, which allows maternal antibodies to provide passive immunity to the foetus.


###Endocrine Function
Synthesises:
- βHCG
- hPL
- Oestriol
- Progesterone

##Development
The placenta develops simulanteously from foetus and mother. From the uterine wall, the mother produces **blood sinuses** around the trophoblastic cords, which in turn send out **placental villi**. The end result is a sinus of maternal blood invaginated by multiple foetal villi.

The foetal villi are supplied by **two umbilical arteries** and a **single umbilical vein**, whilst maternal sinuses are filled from the **uterine arteries**.

The maternal sinuses are supplied by **spiral arteries**.

##Properties of the Developing Placenta
* Thick(er) membrane impairs permeability  
  Placental membrane cpermeability is small in early-to-mid pregnancy, reaching maximum at ~34 weeks GUYTON FIGURE 82.4 on PAGE 1029
* Smaller surface area

##Properties of the Mature Placenta
* Think membrane - improved permeability
* Surface area of 
* Weight of
* Blood flow of 600mL.min<sup>-1</sup> at term  
  It is reduced during contractions due to increased uterine pressure and also with α-adrenergic stimulation
