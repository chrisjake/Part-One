# Starling Forces {#id}

> Describe the essential features of the micro-circulation including fluid exchange (Starling forces) and control mechanisms present in the pre- and post-capillary sphincters

Interstitial fluid is an ultrafiltrate of plasma, with the net filtration pressure determined by the net effect of opposing hydrostatic and oncotic pressures:

$$NFP = P_{Capillary \ Hydrostatic} - P_{Interstitial \ Hydrostatic} - (P_{Capillary \ Oncotic} + P_{Interstitial \ Oncotic})$$

These four variables are known as **Starling's forces**.

Actual fluid movement is (of course) more complicated. **Hydrostatic pressure falls along the capillary**, and movement of solute and water are affected by other factors. Some of these are described by the:
* **Reflection coefficient** (Ïƒ)  
This describes the fact that a small amount of protein leaks from the capillary, slightly increasing interstitial oncotic pressure and slightly decreasing capillary oncotic pressure. It is dependent on the interstitial protein content, and has a value between 0 (low protein content, e.g. glomerular filtrate) and 1 (high protein content, e.g. hepatic sinusoids).

* **Filtration coefficient** (Kf)  
Encompasses membrane permeability (to water) and membrane surface area.

The **Starling Equation** becomes:

$$Net \ Fluid \ Movement =  K_f(P_{CH} - P_{IH} - \theta(P_{CO} + P_{IO})$$




###Typical Values for Pressures (mmHg)
||Arteriolar end|	Venous end |
|--|--|
|**Capillary hydrostatic pressure**|	25|	10
|**Interstitial hydrostatic pressure**|	-6|	-6
|**Capillary oncotic pressure**|	25|	25
|**Interstitial oncotic pressure**|	5|	5


##Causes of Oedema
* **Increased Filtration Pressure**  
    Occurs when capillary hydrostatic pressure exceeds interstitial hydrostatic pressure. Causes:
    * Increased CVP
        * CCF
        * TR
        * Increased venoconstriction
        * Increased MSFP
    * Impaired venous return
        * Obstruction
        * Respiratory muscle pump
        * Skeletal muscle pump
    * Positioning


* **Decreased Oncotic Pressure Gradient**  
    * Decreased plasma protein
        * Hepatic failure
        * Critical Illness
    * Increased interstitial oncotic pressure
        * Mannitol/starch extravasation


* **Increased capillary permeability**  
    * Inflammatory proteins
        * Substance P
        * Histamine
        * Kinins


* **Inadequate Lymph Flow**
