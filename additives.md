#Additives {#id}
> Describe the mechanisms of action and potential adverse effects of buffers, anti-oxidants, anti-microbial and solubilizing agents added to drugs

Additives are components of a drug preparation which do not exert the pharmacological effect.

Additives include:
* **Preservatives**
    * Benzyl alcohol
        * Antimicrobial when > 2%
        * Can be used as a solvent when > 5%
        * Toxic


* **Antioxidants**  
    * Sulfites
        * Hypersensitivity
        * Neurotoxic if given intrathecally


* **Solvents**
    * Water  
    Appropriate for dissolving polar molecules.
    * Non-aqueous solvents  
    Used to dissolve non-polar molecules, or to produce more stable preparations of semi-polar molecules. Examples include:
        * Propylene glycol
            * Hypotension
            * Arrhythmia  
            With rapid injection.
            * Pain on injection
            * Thrombophlebitis
        * Mannitol
            * Diuresis
        * Soybeal oil
            * Pain on injection
            * Allergy


* **Emulsion**  
Formed when drops of a liquid are dispersed throughout another liquid in which it is immiscible. Emulsions are:
    * Unstable  
    Emulsifers are used to enhance stability.
    * Prone to contamination  
    Due to the water component.
    * Prone to rancidity  
    Due to the oil component.


* **Buffers**  
Maintain pH in a particular range in order to:
    * Maximise stability  
    Preserve shelf life.
    * Maintain solubility
    * Maximise preservative function
