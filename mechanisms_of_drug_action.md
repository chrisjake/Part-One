# Mechanisms of Action

Drugs can act in four ways:

* **Receptors**
  * GPCR
  * Intracellular
      * Cytoplasmic
      * Intranuclear  
      e.g. Steroids, which alter RNA expression.


* **Ion Channels**  
  * Blockade
  * Allosteric modulation

                        
* **Enzyme interaction  **  
  An enzyme is a biological catalyst, increasing the speed of reaction. Enzyme interaction can be:
  * Irreversible inhibition  
    * e.g. Aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits platelet thromboxane production.
  * Reversible inhibition
  * Competitive antagonism  
    * e.g. ACE-I.
  * Non-competitive antagonism


* **Physicochemically**
  * Osmotic
    * e.g. mannitol.
  * Acid-base
    * e.g. antacids.
  * Chelation
  * Redox reactions
