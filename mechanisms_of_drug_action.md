# Mechanisms of Action

Drugs can act in three ways:

* **Receptors**
  * Ion Channels
  * GPCR
  * Intracellular
    * Cytoplasmic
    * Intranuclear  
      e.g. Steroids, which alter RNA expression
* **Enzyme interaction  **  
  An enzyme is a biological catalyst, increasing the speed of reaction. Enzyme interaction can be:

  * Irreversible inhibition  
    * e.g. Aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits platelet thromboxane production
  * Reversible inhibition
  * Competitive antagonism  
    * e.g. ACE-I
  * Non-competitive antagonism

* **Physicochemically**

  * Osmotic
    * e.g. mannitol
  * Acid-base
    * e.g. antacids
  * Chelation
  * Redox reactions
