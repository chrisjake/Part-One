# Opioids {#id}

##Common Features
|Property|Effect
|--|--|
|**Uses**|Analgesia, sedation, elimination of sympathetic response to laryngoscopy/surgical stress response|
|**Resp**|↓ CNS sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> causing respiratory depression (↓ RR > ↓ V<sub>T</sub>) - ↑ reliance on hypoxic drive (therefore respiratory depression may be potentiated by high FiO<sub>2</sub>)|
|**CVS**|↓ HR. May ↓ BP due to histamine release (less with synthetic agents). ↑ PVR|
|**CNS**|Sedation, euphoria. Nausea and vomiting due to CTZ stimulation. Meiosis due to stimulation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus.|
|**Renal**|↓ RPF, ↑ ADH, ↑ ureteric and sphincter tone
|**MSK**|Muscle rigidity, pruritis (especially with intrathecal administration)
|**Metabolic**|↓ ACTH, prolactin, gonadotrophic hormone secretion. ↑ ADH secretion|
|**GIT**|↓ Peristalsis and GIT secretions with subsequent constipation|
|**Immunological**|Impaired: chemotaxis, lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production|

##Comparison of Opioids

|Property|Morphine|Fentanyl|Alfentanil|Remifentanil|Oxycodone|
|--|--|
|**Receptor**|MOP, KOP|MOP|MOP|MOP|MOP, KOP, DOP|
|**Route of Administration**|SC/IM/IV/Intrathecal|SC/IM/IV/Epidural/Intrathecal/Transdermal|IV|IV|PO/IV|
|**pKa**|8.0, 23% unionised at physiologic pH.|8.4, < 10% unionised at pH 7.4|6.5, 90% unionised at pH 7.4 conferring rapid onset|7.3 means 58% unionised at physiologic pH.|8.5, < 10% is unionised at physiologic pH.
|**Absorption**|Low (relative) lipid solubility - slower onset and SC absorption. PO preparations absorbed in small bowel. PO bioavailability 30% - high first pass metabolism.|Rapid onset of action (< 30s, peak at 5min) due to lipid solubility (600x that of morphine).|90x more lipid soluble than morphine, but more rapid onset than fentanyl. This is due to: <br>1. Low pKa means a greater proportion is unionised at physiological pH. <br> 2. Lower potency of alfentanil compared to fentanyl means a greater dose is required (Bowman's Principle)|20x more lipid soluble than morphine.|PO bioavailability 60-80%
|**Distribution**|~35% protein binding. V<sub>D</sub> 3.5L.kg<sup>-1</sup>|600x as lipid soluble as morphine conferring a larger V<sub>D</sub> (4L.kg<sup>-1</sup>). 85% protein bound.|90x as lipid soluble as morphine, small V<sub>D</sub> of 0.6L.kg<sup>-1</sup>. 90% protein bound|20x as lipid soluble as morphine, very small V<sub>D</sub> of 0.4L.kg<sup>-1</sup>. 70% protein bound. CSHT is constant due to rapid metabolism. |As lipid soluble as morphine, 45% protein bound, V<sub>D</sub> 3L.kg<sup>-1</sup>|
|**Clearance** (ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>)|15|13|6|40|13|
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic to active metabolites morphine-3-glucoronide and morphine-6-glucoronide|Significant first pass pulmonary endothelial uptake. Hepatic to the inactive metabolite norfentanyl. t<sub>1/2</sub>β of 190 minutes, longer than morphine due to higher lipid solubility and V<sub>D</sub>.|Shorter elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> than fentanyl (100 minutes) despite lower clearance due to lower V<sub>D</sub>. Prolonged with administration of midazolam due to CYP3A3/4 competition|Plasma and tissue esterases|Hepatic to noroxycodone and oxymorphone
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of active metabolites - accumulation in renal failure|Renal elimination of inactive metabolites|Renal elimination of metabolites|Renal of inactive metabolites|Renal elimination of active drug and metabolites
|**Time to Peak Effect (IV)**|10-30 minutes|5 minutes|90 seconds|1-3 minutes|5 minutes|
|**Duration (IV)**|3-4 hours|Variable depending on dose and distribution. With doses > 3μg.kg<sup>-1</sup> tissues become saturated and the duration of action is significantly prolonged|5-10 minutes|Offset 5-10 minutes from ceasing infusion|4 hours|
|**Equianalgesic Dose** (IV, to 10mg IV morphine)| 10mg|150mcg|1mg|50mcg|10mg
