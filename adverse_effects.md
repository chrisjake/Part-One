#Adverse effects {#id}
>Classify and describe adverse drug effects.

An **adverse effect** is a "noxious or unintended effect associated with administration of a drug at the **normal dose**" (i.e., not overdose)[^1].

It is distinct from an **adverse event**, which is an "untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a drug but does not necessarily have a causal relationship"[^1].

17% of hospital inpatients have an adverse effect to a drug[^2], and 7% have a serious adverse effect[^3]. They occur mainly in young and middle-aged individuals, and are twice as common in women. They may be exacerbated by asthma and pregnancy.

Multiple mechanisms have been implicated but these are not fully understood. Adverse events can be **classified** by the **ABC system**[^1]:

##Type A Adverse Reactions
These are related to the pharmacological action of the drug. They are:
* Common
* Dose-response relationship
* Temporally associated with drug administration
* Reproducible
* Pharmacologically predictable based on understanding of the drug in question

They typically result in:
* Organ-selective injury
* More pronounced with long-term use and in risk groups:
    * Extremes of age
    * Pregnancy
    * Renal failure
* High morbidity but low mortality

Treatment is to decrease dose.

> Hypokalaemia secondary to diuretic use

##Type B Adverse Reactions
These are patient-specific or idiosyncratic reactions. They are:
* Rare  
  Potentially genetic anomaly but poorly understood.
* No dose-response relationship and occur with low doses
* Mechanism not pharmacologically predictable. Important causes include:
    * Acetylator status
    * CYP450 variants
    * Enzyme alterations/deficiencies  
    E.g. Suxamethonium apnoea
* Not necessarily reproducable

They typically result in:
* Immunoallergic reactions
* Pseudoallergy
* Idiosyncratic reaction
* Low morbidity but high mortality

Treatment is to cease the medication.

> SJS or anaphylaxis following penicillin administration

##Type C Adverse Reactions
These are 'statistical effects' associated with monitoring. They are:
* Typically an increased frequency of background disease
* Atypical for drug reaction and not pharmacological predictable
* No identifiable temporal relationship
* Not reproducable
