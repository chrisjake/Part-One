#End-Tidal Gas Analysis
> Describe the principles of ~~pulse and tissue oximetry, co-oximetry and~~ capnography, including calibration, sources of errors and limitations 

##Principles
Several mechanisms for E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> measurement exist:
* Infrared Spectroscopy
* Colourimetric Methods
* Rayman Scattering
* Gas Chromatography

##Infrared Spectroscopy
End-tidal gas analysis using infrared light is used in the measurement of:
* CO<sub>2</sub>  
Capnography is the continuous measurement and graphical display of the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in expired gas.
* Anaesthetic agents

This is the most common method to measure E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>. Gases with two or more different atoms will **absorb infrared radiation**, with **different gases absorbing different wavelengths** to different degrees.

By **combining this knowledge** about absorbed wavelengths with the **likely composition** of a mixture, a system can be designed using a specific wavelength to measure gas concentrations and avoid interference.

CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs infrared radiation at a peak wavelength of 4.28μm. A sapphire sampling chamber contains the gas sample, on either side of which exists an emitter and a detector. The chamber only allows infrared radiation of one particular wavelength through. Levels of radiation are measured on the other side of the chamber (using a lens to focus it, and a detector to measure it), and correspond to the amount of gas present in the sample. The less radiation that reaches the detector, the more gas there is in the sample absorbing it.

###Equipment Errors
* Variable amount of infrared radiation released
* Variable sensitivity of the detector
* Variable efficacy of the crystal window and lens system

These can be overcome by use of **double-beam capnometer**. These use a reference chamber which contains CO<sub>2</sub>-free air, and the same emitter-detector system. All absorption from this system must occur due to artifact (as no gas is present). The artifactual component is then subtracted from the value detected in the main chamber.

The **collision broadening effect** also may affect measurements. Intermolecular forces vary depending on their proximity to other molecules in the gas mixture. A change in intermolecular forces may alter their bond-energy and the frequencies at which they absorb radiation. It can be overcome by correcting for the presence of other gases, or manually adjusting the obtained values.

###In Practice
E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> may be either **side-stream** or **in-line**.
* Side-stream CO<sub>2</sub> involves a length of narrow tubing drawing gas from the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (typically from the HME filter) to the capnograph. These require a flow of 150 ml.min<sup>-1</sup>, and have an insignificant delay (<1s) in measurement. They require use of a water trap to remove condensation, though may still become blocked with water.
* In-line systems have a sampling chamber attached in-line with the ETT, which slightly increases the dead-space of the circuit. They also require heating to 41°C to avoid condensation.


###E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> Waveform and Variations
The normal trace consists of four components:
1. The **baseline** (with no respiratory effort) and **Dead-space exhalation**, where E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> should be **0**
2. **Alveolar exhalation**, where E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> **rises rapidly**
3. **Alveolar plateau**, where E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> **flattens**. The highest-point of this curve is the E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>-tension.
4. **Inspiration**, where E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> returns to **0**

###Changes in E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
Normal E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> is 32-42 mmHg, whilst normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> is 35-45 mmHg.

####High E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
This may be from:
* Decreased ventilation
    * Decreased RR
    * Decreased TV
    * Increased V<sub>D</sub> and therefore a greater V<sub>D</sub>:V<sub>T</sub> ratio
* Increased production of CO<sub>2</sub>
    * Increased metabolic rate
        * Sepsis
    * Torniquet release
    * ROSC following arrest
* Increased inspired 
    * Rebreathing (i.e. equipment/ventilator malfunction)
    * External source of added CO<sub>2</sub>

####Low E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
#####Rapid Loss of E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
* Failure of ventilation
    * Circuit disconnect
    * Airway obstruction
    * Bronchospasm
* Failure of circulation
    * Cardiac arrest
    * Shock

#####Gradual Loss of E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
* Increased V<sub>Alv</sub> (i.e. increased MV)
* Decreased CO<sub>2</sub> production
    * Hypometabolic state
        * Hypothermia
* Increased V<sub>D</sub>, i.e. V/Q mismatch
    * Increased West Zone I physiology:
        * Hypotension
        * Increased RV Afterload:
            * PE
            * High PEEP
* Sampling error
    * Air entrainment into the sample chamber
    * Inadequate V<sub>T</sub>

###Discrepancy between E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, PACO<sub>2</sub>, and PaCO<sub>2</sub>
The normal gradient between PaCO<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> is 0-5 mmHg. Healthy and awake individuals should have essentially no (<1ml) alveolar dead space, and so essentially no gradient. This gradient is increased in patients with:
* V/Q mismatch
    * E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> will underestimate arterial CO<sub>2</sub> as gas from un-perfused alveoli (with negligible CO<sub>2</sub>) will dilute CO<sub>2</sub> expired gas

##Colourimetric Methods
Litmus paper which changes colour when exposed to hydrogen ions (produced by CO<sub>2</sub>) can be used to confirm endo-tracheal intubation, though they may generate false-positive results due to gastric pH.
