#Airway and Alveolar Anatomy {#id}
> Describe the function and structure of the upper, lower airway and alveolus.

##Upper Airway
The upper airway consists of the:
* **Mouth**
* **Nasal cavity**  
  * Hairs filter large particles
  * Olfactory receptors detect harmful gases prior to inhalation
* **Pharynx**
* **Larynx**

Breathing can be oral or nasal. Nasal breathing offers:
* Good **humidification** and **filtration** of inhaled particles because the septum and turbinates have:
  * High mucosal surface area
  * High muscosal blood flow
  * Generate turbulent flow
* High resistance to flow  
At a **high minute ventilation**, oral breathing is favoured

###Structures
* **Pharyngeal dilator muscles**  
Including glenioglossus and levator palate. Prevent pharnygeal collapse during negative-pressure ventilation and during sleep.


* **Larynx**  
    Important for **airway protection**, **speech**, and **effort closure**.
    * Prevents aspiration during swallowing by elevating the epiglottis and occluding of the aryepiglottic folds
    * **Phonation** is achieved by adjusting tension (and therefore resonance) of the vocal cords by action of the cricothyroid
    * During **inspiration**, **cricoarytenoid** muscles rotate the arytenoid cartilage and abduct the vocal cords to reduce resistance to airflow
    * During **expiration**, the **thyroarytenoid** muscles adduct the cords and increase resistance, providing **intrinsic PEEP**
      * 3-4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP is generated
      * Maintains patency of small airways  
      Prevents alveolar collapse and therefore maintains FRC.
    * **Effort closure** is tighter occlusion of the laryngeal inlet, in which the aryepiglottic muscles contract strongly to act as a sphincter, allowing the airway to withstand up to 120cmH<sub>2</sub>O of pressure.


##Lower Airway
The lower airway consists of the **tracheobronchial tree**:
* From trachea to alveolus, the airways of the lungs **divide 23 times**  
The tracheobronchial tree is divided into two zones, based on whether they contain alveoli and therefore are able to participate in gas exchange:
  * The **conducting zone** is the first **16 divisions**
  * The **respiratory zone** is the last 7 divisions

###Conducting Zone
The **first 16 divisions** constitute the **conducting zone**:
* Anatomically, the conducting zone consists of:
  *  **Trachea**  
    * Mean diameter of 1.8 cm and a length of 11cm
    * D-shaped cross section  
    Curved cartilages anteriorly and longitudinal muscle (trachealis) posterioly. External pressure of 40cmH<sub>2</sub>O is sufficient to occlude the extrathoracic trachea.
  *  **Bronchi**
    * Comprise the first four divisions of the trachea
    * Right main bronchus is wider and deviates less from the axis of the trachea (the left main bronchus has a tighter turn over the heart), which is why foreign bodies will tend to the right side
    * The two main bronchi divide into a total of 5 lobar bronchi, which in turn divide into a total of 18 segmental bronchi
      * Cross-sectional area of the respiratory tract is lowest at the third division
      * These bronchi will collapse when intrathoracic pressure exceeds intraluminal pressure by ~5cmH<sub>2</sub>O.
      * Segmental bronchi travel with branches of the pulmonary artery and lymphatics  
      These are the bronchi that demonstrate peribronchial cuffing and perihilar haze in early pulmonary oedema.
  *  **Bronchioles**  
    * Embedded in the lung parenchyma
    * Do not have cartilage in their walls to maintain patency - are held open by lung volume
    * Resistance to flow tends to be negligible due to large cross sectional area, unless there is spasm of helical muscle bands in bronchial wall
  *  **Terminal bronchioles**


* Flow in the conducting zone during inspiration is fast and turbulent
* No gas exchange occurs in the conducting zone  
The volume of the conducting zone therefore contributes to **anatomic dead space**
* Blood supply to the conducting zone is via the **bronchial circulation** 


* **Mucous** is secreted by **goblet cells** in the bronchial walls to trap inhaled particles
* **Cilia** in the bronchial walls move rhythmically to move the staircase of mucuous up to the epiglottis, where it is then swallowed.

###Respiratory Zone
The **remaining 7 divisions** make up the **respiratory zone**. This region:
* Makes up the majority of lung volume  
All non-anatomical dead space volume is in the respiratory zone, and is **~3L** (FRC) at rest
* Blood supply to is via the pulmonary circulation
* Gas flow in the respiratory zone is slow due to the exponential increase in cross-sectional area with each airway division
  * Diffusion is the predominant mechanism of gas movement.

##Alveolus
The alveolus is optimised for gas exchange:
* Spherical shape maximises surface area to volume ratio
* Total surface area of lung alveoli is 50-100m<sup>2</sup>
* Alveolar walls are extremely thin (0.2-0.3μm)  
Consequently, they are fragile and can be damaged by increases in capillary pressure
* Alveolar walls contain a dense mesh of capillaries **7 to 10μm** thick, which is just large enough for an erythrocyte to pass through  
The alveolar-capillary barrier consists of three layers:
  * Type I pneumocytes
  * Extracellular matrix
  * Pulmonary capillary endothelium

Alveoli are composed of three types of cells:
* **Type I pneumocytes**  
Thin-walled epithelial cells optimised for gas exchange.
  * Form ~90% of the alveolar surface area


* **Type II pneumocytes**  
Specialised secretory cells.
  * Secrete surfactant  
  Alveoli are also inherently unstable, and surface tension of alveolar fluid favours collapse of the alveoli. **Surfactant** reduces surface tension, allowing the alveoli to expand.
  * Form ~10% of alveolar surface area


* **Alveolar macrophages**  
Alveoli have no cilia - inhaled particles are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in alveolar septa and lung interstitium.
