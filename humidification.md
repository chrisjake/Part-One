# Humidification
> Define humidity and give an outline of the importance of humidification

Humidification describes the amount of water vapour present in air:
* **Absolute Humidity** is the amount of water vapour in a given volume of air (g.m<sup>-3</sup>)
* **Relative Humidity** is the ratio between the amount of water vapour in a sample of air (absolute humidity) and the amount of water required to fully saturate that sample at its current pressure and temperature

Humidification of inspired air is important to avoid drying out mucosa and sputum, which leads to tissue damage and failure of the mucociliary elevator. Optimal function requires a relative humidity of **greater than 75%**.

##Mechanism
The nose is optimised for humidification, as the **septum** and **turbinates** **increase surface area** and create **turbulent flow**, both of which increase the contact of air with mucosal surfaces.

This makes the nose the preferred orifice for breathing unless airways resistance becomes a significantly limiting factor. This occurs in obstruction (e.g. polyps) or at high minute ventilations (> 35L.<sup>-1</sup>). Mouth breathing reduces humidity of inspired air to **60%**.

Fluid lining the airway acts as a heat and moisture exchanger. In inspiration, relatively dry air is evaporates water from the airway lining. This increasing relative humidity to 90% in the nasopharynx and 100% BTPS by the second generation of bronchi. This gives a water vapour pressure of **44mmHg** at BTPS, with an absolute humidity of **44g.m<sup>-3</sup>**.

During expiration, the air cools in the upper airway and moisture condenses (as cooler air has a lower saturated vapour pressure) on the airway and is reabsorbed. This reduces potential water losses from the airway from **300ml.day<sup>-1</sup>** to **150ml.day<sup>-1</sup>**.
