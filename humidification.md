# Humidification
> Define humidity and give an outline of the importance of humidification

Humidification describes the amount of water vapour present in air:
* **Absolute Humidity** is the amount of water vapour in a given volume of air (g.m<sup>-3</sup>)
* **Relative Humidity** is the ratio between the amount of water vapour in a sample of air (absolute humidity) and the amount of water required to fully saturate that sample at its current pressure and temperature


* **Moisture** is the water produced by condensation when relative humidity exceeds 100%.


* Humidification of inspired air is important to avoid drying out mucosa and sputum, which leads to tissue damage and failure of the mucociliary elevator
* Optimal function requires a relative humidity of **greater than 75%**

##Mechanism
The nose is:
* Optimised for humidification  
The **septum** and **turbinates** increase contact of air with mucosal surfaces by:
 * Increasing **surface area**
 * Generating **turbulent flow**
* The preferred orifice for breathing unless airways resistance becomes a significantly limiting factor  
This is relevant in:
 * Airway obstruction (e.g. polyps)
 * At high minute ventilations (> 35L.<sup>-1</sup>)
* Humidifies inspired gas to 90%, compared to **60%** for the mouth

Method of humidification:
* Fluid lining the airway acts as a heat and moisture exchanger
* In inspiration:
 * Relatively dry air is evaporates water from the airway lining
 * Relative humidity is increased to 90% in the nasopharynx and 100% BTPS by the second generation of bronchi  
 This gives a water vapour pressure of **47mmHg** at BTPS, with an absolute humidity of **44g.m<sup>-3</sup>**.
* In expiration:
 * Air cools in the upper airway  
 As cooler air has a lower saturated vapour pressure, moisture condenses on the airway.
 * Moisture is reabsorbed  
 This reduces potential water losses from the airway from **300ml.day<sup>-1</sup>** to **150ml.day<sup>-1</sup>**.
