> Describe the function, distribution, regulation and physiological importance of sodium~~, chloride, potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate~~ ions

Normal total body Na<sup>+</sup> is 60mmol.kg<sup>-1</sup> 70% of which is exchangeable. Total body Na<sup>+</sup> is distributed as:
* 50% in ECF  
Sodium is the dominant extracellular cation.
  * Typical ECF [Na<sup>+</sup>] of 140mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>.
* 45% in bone
* 5% in ICF  
A minor intracellular cation.  
  * ICF [Na<sup>+</sup>] varies with cell type, but is typically 12-20mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>.
  * Concentration is kept low by the action of the 2Na<sup>+</sup>-3K<sup>+</sup> ATPase exchange pump and the low permeability of the cellular membrane to Na<sup>+</sup>



##Function
* **Regulation of ECF volume**  
  Principal ECF cation. Changes in sodium levels cause compensatory fluid shifts. Loss of sodium *content* will result in hypotension/hypovolaemia, with consequent baroreceptor stimulation and activation of the RAAS. Baroreceptors will activate with a **7-10% change in volume**.

* **Osmolarity**  
  Changes in sodium *concentration* affect osmoreceptors and will affect ADH and thirst mechanisms. Osmoreceptors will activate with a **1-2% change in osmolality**.
* **Acid-Base balance**  
  Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchange pumps in the kidney are stimulated in acidosis.

* **Resting Membrane Potential**  
Alterations in sodium concentration will affect intracellular potassium to a similar degree, which will alter the RMP.

##Regulation
Total body Na<sup>+</sup> content is regulated to within 2%. Regulation of any system is typically a balance between **input** and **output**, however sodium intake is **essentially unregulated**. Sodium is therefore regulated by adjusting methods of elimination.


Sodium is eliminated in:
* Sweat and GIT  
Obligatory and not amenable to regulation.
  * Acclimatisation to hot environments improves the efficiency of sweating by reducing its tonicity, reducing sodium loss
* GIT
* Urine  
Regulation of sodium is predominantly via adjusting renal elimination, and is mediated primarily by **aldosterone**.

###Urinary Elimination of Sodium
Urinary elimination can be adjusted in two ways:
* **Changes in GFR**  
Changes in GFR due to hyper or hypovolaemia will (indirectly) adjust sodium elimination. Increased plasma volume increases GFR, and vice versa.

* **Changes in sodium reabsorption**  
This is the main mechanism for controlling sodium in euvolaemia.

####Sodium Reabsorption
Given that:
* Normal glomerular filtrate is ~180L.day<sup>-1</sup> 
* The dominant osmole in glomerular filtrate is sodium
* Normal urine output is ~1.5L<sup>-1</sup>


The majority of filtered sodium must be reabsorbed. This is called **bulk reabsorption** and occurs in the PCT and LOH:
* 60% of total reabsorption is by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump in the PCT
* 30% of total reabsorption is by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter in the LOH


The remaining 10% of sodium reabsorption occurs in the DCT and CT. As it is under the influence of aldosterone, it is the component which is important in regulation. Aldosterone increases Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption by increasing the number or activity of these pumps:
* Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> pumps in the DCT
* Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pumps in **principal cells** of the DCT
* Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> pumps in **intercalated cells** of the CT
