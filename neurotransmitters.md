> Describe the major neurotransmitters and their physiological role, with particular reference to GABA, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin and NMDA receptor

##GABA

Gamma aminobutyric acid is the major inhibitory CNS neurotransmitter.

GABA receptors have three subtypes:
* GABA<sub>A</sub>  
Ionotropic receptor important for the action of many drugs.
    * Pentameric structure
        * 2 α  
        Bind GABA.
        * 2 β
        * 1 γ
    * Affected by many different drugs:
        * Benzodiazepines  
        Positive allosteric modulation at at the α/γ interface.
        * General anaesthetic agents  
        Including propofol, barbiturates, halogenated volatiles, and etomidate.
            * Act at the β subunit
            Cause a conformational change which increases Cl<sup>-</sup> opening time, hyperpolarising the cell.
* GABA<sub>B</sub>  
Metabotropic receptor.
* GABA<sub>C</sub>  
Ionotropic receptor located only in the retina.


##NMDA

N-methyl D-asparate receptor is an ionotropic receptor that is:
* Agonised by glutamate
    * Glycine is co-agonist
* Voltage dependent  
    * Central pore usually blocked by an Mg<sup2+</sup> ion
    * Becomes unblocked when partially depolarised
* Important in the action of drugs which do not act at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor   
Agonised by:
    * Ketamine
    * Xenon
    * N<sub>2</sub>
