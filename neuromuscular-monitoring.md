#Neuromuscular Monitoring

> Describe the concept of depth of neuromuscular blockade and explain the use of neuromuscular monitoring

> <p style="color:purple";>Describe the clinical features ~~and management~~ of inadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade</p>

The degree of neuromuscular blockade can be assessed:
* Clinically  
Crude compared to electrical assessment. Tests include:
    * Sustained head lift > 5 seconds  
    Suggests < 30% blockade.
    * V<sub>T</sub> > 10ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>
    * Tongue protrusion
* Electrically  
Using a nerve stimulator. Can be:
    * Visual/tactile  
    Monitoring of twitch height by anaesthetist.
    * Electrical  
    Monitoring of twitch height by a device, e.g. accelerometer.
    
##Nerve Stimulator
A nerve stimulator:
* Consists of two electrodes, a power supply, and some buttons for control
* Produces a monophasic, **square wave** at **constant current**, lasting no more than **0.3ms**
* Generates a **supra-maximal stimulus**  
Ensures every nerve fibre is depolarised, which means a consistently reproducible response will be generated. A supra-maximal stimulus is 25% greater than the maximum required to depolarise all nerve fibres.
* Allows assessment of different muscle groups  
Not all muscle groups are affected equally by neuromuscular blockade.
    * Typically **smaller muscle** groups are **more sensitive**
    * The **positive** (red) lead is placed **proximal**
    * Ulnar nerve  
    Electrodes are placed along the ulnar border of the wrist at the flexor crease, and thumb adduction is assessed.
    * Facial nerve  
    The positive electrode is placed at the outer canthus, and the negative electrode is placed anterior to the tragus. Eyebrow twitching is assessed.
    * Posterior tibial nerve  
    Electrodes are placed posterior to the medial malleolus, and plantar flexion is assessed.
    
###Stimulation Patterns
There are five common stimulation patterns:
* **Train of Four**  
Four identical 2Hz stimuli 0.5s apart.
    * Number of observed twitches gives an indication of receptor occupancy  
    With increasing blockade, the number of observed twitches decreases:
        * No twitches ≈ 100% blockade
        * One twitch ≈ 90% blockade
        * Two twitches ≈ 80% blockade
        * Three twitches ≈ 75% blockade
        * Four twitches ≈ < 75% blockade
    * **Fade** is the reduction of twitch height with repeated stimuli during a partial neuromuscular block.
    * The ratio of the amplitude of T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>4</sub> (ToF ratio) can also be used as a measure of blockade:
        * ToF ratio > 90% is adequate for extubation
        * ToF ratio > 70% suggests adequate respiratory function
* **Tetanic stimulation**  
High frequency (50-200Hz) supramaximal stimulus for 5 seconds.
    * Normal muscle will exhibit tetanic contraction
    * neuromuscular blockers will demonstrate fade
* Double burst
* Single twitch  
A single stimulus lasting ~0.2ms is applied.
    * \> 75% blockade causes a depressed response
    * A twitch must be assessed prior to blockade so a baseline can be established
