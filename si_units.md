# SI Units

The International System of Units (**SI**, or *Système International d'Unités*, is a set of  measurement standards which defines (almost) all standards in terms of uniform natural phenomena, and form the base of the metric system. 

##Base SI Units
There are **seven base SI units**, with **many derived units** made from combinations of these. Base SI units are mutually independent. They consist of:

|Quantity|Unit|Abbreviation|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|**Time**|Second|s|Duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of an atom of Cs-133
|**Length**|Metre|m|Distance that light travels in a vacuum in  1/299,792,458<sup>th</sup> of a second
|**Current**|Ampere|A|The constant current that would produce a force of 2x10<sup>-7</sup> Newton between two conductors of infinite length and negligible cross section in a vacuum
|**Temperature**|Kelvin|°K|1/273.16<sup>th</sup> of the triple point of water
|**Amount**|Mole|mol|The amount of substance which contains as many elementary entities as in 0.012kg of Carbon 12
|**Luminous Intensity**|Candella|cd|Luminous intensity of a source which emits monochromatic radiation at 540 x 10<sup>12</sup> Hz at radiant intensity of 1/683 watts per steradian
|**Mass**|Kilogram|kg|Weight of the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK)

#Derived Units
|Quantity|Unit|Abbreviation|Conversion to Base SI Units|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|Area|Square metre|m<sup>2</sup>|$$m^2$$||
|Velocity|Metre per Second|m.s<sup>-1</sup>|$$m \over s$$||
|Acceleration|Metre per Second per Second|m.s<sup>-2</sup>|$$m \over s^2$$||
|Force|Newton|N|$$N={kg.m \over s^2}$$|Force required to accelerate 1kg at 1m.s<sup>-2</sup>
|Pressure|Pascal|Pa|$$Pa = {N \over m^2} = {kg \over m.s^2} $$|Force per area
|Energy/Work/Quantity of Heat|Joule|J|$$J = N.m = {kg.m^2 \over s^2 }$$|Energy converted when 1N is applied over 1m
|Dose Equivalence|Sievert|Sv|$$Sv = {J \over kg} = {m^2 \over s^2 }$$|Radiation dose per mass
|Power|Watt|W|$$W = {J \over s} = {kg.m^2 \over s^3 }$$|Rate of energy conversion per second
|Electromotive Force|Volt|V|$$ V = {W \over A} = {kg.m^2 \over A.s^3 }$$|Measure of electrical potential energy
