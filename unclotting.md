# Haemostatic Regulation
> Describe the mechanisms of preventing thrombosis including endothelial factors and natural anticoagulants

Haemostasis must be controlled to prevent rampant clotting of the vascular tree. This involves both endothelial factors and proteins.

##Endothelial Regulation
Intact endothelium prevents clotting in a number of ways:
* **Inhibition of platelet adhesion and activation**  
NO, prostacyclin, and adenosine diphosphate (which degrades ADP) inhibit platelet activation.


* **Membrane-bound anticoagulant proteins**  
    * **Hepar*an*** (not hepar*in*) activates antithrombin III
    * **Thrombomodulin** binds thrombin, preventing cleavage of fibrinogen. The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex activates protein C (which in turn inactivates factors Va and VIIIa).


* **tPA secretion** (see 'Clot Lysis')

##Clot Regulation
* Dilution of clotting factors
* Activation of anticoagulant factors
    * **Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor**  
    Inhibits VIIa, antagonising the action of tissue factor
    * **Antithrombin III**  
    Inhibits the **serine proteases**, i.e. the non-cofactor factors in all three pathways - IIa, VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa.    
    * **Protein C**  
    Inactivates protein Va and VIIIa, and is activated by thrombin.
    * **Protein S**  
    Cofactor which helps protein C.


##Clot Lysis
Clot breakdown is performed by:
* Tissue Plasminogen Activator (**tPA**)  
Binds to fibrin, and then cleaves plasminogen to plasmin. This keeps the plasmin formation in the vicinity of the clot, limiting systemic spread of plasmin.

* **Plasmin** cleaves fibrin into **fibrin degradation products**. These products conveniently inhibit thrombin and fibrin formation.
