#Spirometry

> Describe the pressure and flow-volume relationships of the lung, chest wall and the total respiratory system


Spirometers measure flow and (by integrating for time) volume. 
 
 
 
##Basic Measurements
Basic measurements obtained include:
* Static lung volumes
* Forced Expiratory Volume over one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)  
The volume of air that can be forcible exhaled in one second.
* Forced Vital Capacity (FEV)  
The volume of air which can be exhaled.
  * Peak flow
  * Flow-volume loops
 
 
 VOLUME TIME GRAPH PAGE 57 CHAMBERS

   * In obstructive airways disease:
     * FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted
     * FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio <0.7
   * Restrictive disease:
     * FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted
     * FVC <80% predicted
     * FEV/FVC ratio >0.7  
     The ratio is normal as the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC fall proportionally.
     
##Flow-Volume Loops
FLOW VOLUME LOOPS

* **Normal**
  * Peak expiratory flow of **~8L.s<sup>-1</sup>**  
  Initial flow is highest as the increased lung volume **increases the calibre** of lung airways, reducing airways resistance.
    * This is called the **effort dependent** part of the curve
  * Flow tails off later in expiration  
    * Lungs collapse, and airway calibre falls
    * Small airways are compressed  
    Any increase in expiratory pressure will increase airway resistance proportionally.
      * This creates a uniform flow rate, and is called **dynamic airways compression**
      * This is also known as the **effort independent** part of the curve
  
  
* **Obstructive lung disease**  
  * RV is increased due to gas trapping
  * Peak flow is limited
  * Effort-independent portion becomes concave
   
   
* **Restrictive lung disease**
  * TLC is limited
  * Peak flow is limited
  * Effort independent part is linear


* **Fixed airway obstruction**  
  * Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates are limited


* **Variable extrathoracic obstruction**  
  * Variable means the obstruction moves
  * During inspiration the lesion is pulled into trachea and inspiratory flow is reduced
  * During expiration the lesion is pushed out of the trachea  
  The way to remember this is an **extra**thoracic obstruction impedes **in**spiration
  * The reverse effect occurs in positive pressure ventilation


* **Variable intrathoracic obstruction**  
The opposite to extrathoracic obstruction.
  * During inspiration the airway calibre increases and the degree of obstruction reduced
  * During expiration the airway calibre falls and the obstruction worsens
