Pulmonary function tests are performd with a **spirometer**, which measures either volume or flow (integrated for time) to quantify lung function.

Basic spirometry can be used to quantify:
* Lung volumes and capacities  
All except residual volume (and therefore FRC and TLC).
* Dynamic measurements
    * FEV<sub>1</sub>  
    Volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second.
    * FVC  
    Forced vital capacity.
    * PEFR  
    Peak expiratory flow rate.
    * Flow-volume loop

Additional testing can be performed to measure:
* Residual volume  
FRC and TLC can therefore be calculated.
* Diffusion capacity

##Basic Spirometry
Basic spirometry includes:
* Forced spirometry  
Patient forcibly exhales a vital capacity breath, producing a exponential (wash-in) curve. This calculates:
    * PEFR from the gradient at time 0 (assuming maximal effort)
    * FEV<sub>1</sub> is the volume expired in 1s  
    Normal is > 80% of predicted.
    * FVC is the total volume exhaled.
    * The FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio  
    Normal is > 0.7.
    * These values also quantify disease severity:
      * In obstructive airways disease:
        * FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted
        * FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio <0.7
      * Restrictive disease:
        * FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted
        * FVC <80% predicted
        * FEV/FVC ratio >0.7  
        The ratio is normal as the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC fall proportionally.

* Volume-Time Graph (Spirogram)  
Quantifies static lung volumes by having a patient perform:
  * Normal tidal breathing
  * Vital capacity breath
  * Vital capacity exhalation

##Flow-Volume Loops
FLOW VOLUME LOOPS

* **Normal**
  * Peak expiratory flow of **~8L.s<sup>-1</sup>**  
  Initial flow is highest as the increased lung volume **increases the calibre** of lung airways, reducing airways resistance.
    * This is called the **effort dependent** part of the curve
  * Flow tails off later in expiration  
    * Lungs collapse, and airway calibre falls
    * Small airways are compressed  
    Any increase in expiratory pressure will increase airway resistance proportionally.
      * This creates a uniform flow rate, and is called **dynamic airways compression**
      * This is also known as the **effort independent** part of the curve
  
  
* **Obstructive lung disease**  
  * RV is increased due to gas trapping
  * Peak flow is limited
  * Effort-independent portion becomes concave
   
   
* **Restrictive lung disease**
  * TLC is reduced, but residual volume is unchanged
  * Peak flow is reduced
  * Effort independent part is linear


* **Fixed airway obstruction**  
  * Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates are limited


* **Variable *extrathoracic* obstruction**  
  * Variable means the obstruction moves
  * During inspiration the lesion is pulled into trachea so inspiratory flow is reduced
  * During expiration the lesion is pushed out of the trachea  
  The way to remember this is an **extra**thoracic obstruction impedes **in**spiration
  * The reverse effect occurs in positive pressure ventilation


* **Variable *intrathoracic* obstruction**  
The opposite to extrathoracic obstruction.
  * During inspiration the airway calibre increases and inspiratory flow is unimpeded
  * During expiration the airway calibre falls and expiratory flow is reduced
