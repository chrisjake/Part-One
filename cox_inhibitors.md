#COX Inhibitors

Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors are typically **used** to treat **mild to moderate pain**. Oral COX inhibitors typically have **rapid absorption**, are **highly-protein bound**, and have a **low Vd**.

##Common Features
###Mechanism of Action
PATHWAY OF ARACHIDONIC ACID VIA COX AND LOX

Arachidonic acid is converted into:
* Leukotrienes by LOX
* Cyclic endoperoxidases by COX  
NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase.
  * There are two(ish) **isoenzymes** of COX:
    * **COX-1**  
    Important for homeostatic function, and controls the synthesis of:  
      * **Thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>**  
      Produced by platelets when exposed to collagen, adrenaline, or adenosine. It promotes haemostasis through:
       *  Vasoconstriction
       *  Platelet aggregation
      * **PGE<sub>2</sub>**
        * Afferent arteriolar dilation
        * Bronchodilation
        * Gastric mucous production
        * Inhibition of platelet aggregation
      * **PGF<sub>2Î±</sub>**
        * Bronchoconstriction
        * Pulmonary vasoconstriction
        * Uterine contraction<br><br>
    * **COX-2**  
    **Induced** with tissue damage and contributes to inflammation. COX-2:
      * Exists in the vascular endothelium where it synthesises prostacyclin (which opposes the action of thromboxanes)
        * Inhibition may result in a relative abundance of thromboxane, causing platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction <br><br>
    * **COX-3** is:
      * A variant of COX-1 which exists centrally and mediates the analgesic and antipyretic effects of paracetamol
 
###Effects 
* COX inhibition has different effects in different tissues:
  * Prevents subsequent conversion of prostaglandins to thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> and PGI<sub>2</sub>  
  * Peripherally, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is anti-inflammatory
  * Centrally, it is anti-pyretic
  * In the stomach, it decreases mucous production and leads to mucosal ulceration


* Aspirin (a non-specific COX inhibitor), prevents production of both thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> and PGI<sub>2</sub>
  * As platelets **have no nucleus**, the COX inhibition remains for the entirety of the platelet lifespan
  * Endothelial cells will produce new COX within hours, and so its anti-inflammatory effects are temporary


###Adverse Effects
* **Asthma**  
Occurs in 20% of asthmatics with NSAID use.

* **Thrombotic events**, including MI and CVA  
Risk is greater with COX-2 inhibitors, with NNH for non-fatal MI being 500 patient-years, and NNH for fatal MI being 1000 patient-years.

* **Platelet dysfunction**  
A consequence of COX-1 inhibiton only, and may result in increased perioperative bleeding risk (though decreased AMI and CVA risk).

* **Impaired GFR**  
Occurs as a consequence of uninhibited afferent arteriolar constriction.

* **Gastric erosion**  
A consequence of impaired mucosal secretion through COX-1 inhibition. This can result in pain, anaemia, or fatal bleed. In general, risk of gastric erosion is (from highest to lowest risk):
  * Ketorolac
  * Diclofenac/naproxen
  * Ibuprofen (<1.2g/day)
  * COX-2 Inhibitors


* **Transaminitis** may occur following NSAID use

|**Respiratory**| Aspirin uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, increasing O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production. It also may stimulate, and (at higher doses) depress the respiratory centre. In overdose, these are significant, and may result in a **mixed** respiratory and metabolic **acidosis**.||||||
