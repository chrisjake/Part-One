# Definitions

##A
* **Absorption**  
The rate at which a drug leaves its site of administration and the extent to which this occurs.

* **Acid**  
A proton donor.

* **Acidaemia**  
Arterial blood pH < 7.35.


* **Acidosis**  
A process which leads to an excess of hydrogen ions, and *may* lead to acidaemia if there is inadequate compensation. Can be subdivided into:
    * **Respiratory acidosis**: PaCO<sub>2</sub> > 45
    * **Metabolic alkalosis**: HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> < 22



* **Activity**  
The *effective* concentration of a substance in a reacting system

* **Adiabatic**  
A process that occurs without transfer of heat or matter. For example, gases heat up when compressed (greater than the energy used to compress them), and cool when allowed to expand (adiabatic cooling).

* **Affinity**  
Ability of a drug to bind to a receptor.

* **Afterload**
Sum of impedances to ventricular ejection.

* **Agonist**  
Drug which produces a maximal response at receptor site.

* **Alkalaemia**  
Arterial blood pH > 7.45.

* **Alkalosis**  
A process which leads to a deficit of hydrogen ions, and *may* lead to alkalaemia if there is inadequate compensation. Can be subdivided into:
    * **Respiratory acidosis**: PaCO<sub>2</sub> < 35
    * **Metabolic alkalosis**: HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> > 26

* **Anaesthesia**  
Without sensation.

* **Analogue Signal**  
Where the output of the transducer varies with the input signal.

* **Anion**
Negatively charged ion.

* **Anode**  
The electrode which conventional current flows into.

* **Anrep effect**  
Method of myocardial autoregulation in which an increase in afterload causes an increase in contractility. 

* **Antagonist**  
Drug which produces no response at the receptor, but prevents other ligands binding.

* **Autoregulation**  
Ability of an organ to maintain homeostasis in the presence of dynamic physiological conditions.

* **Azeotrope**  
A mixture of two substances that cannot be separated by fractional distillation, as each component shares same boiling point. This is typically temperature dependent.

##B
* **Boiling Point**  
The temperature at which the vapour pressure of a liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid.
    * Therefore boiling point decreases as environmental pressure falls, as there is less external pressure keeping molecules in their liquid state
    * Boiling differs from evaporation as molecules anywhere in the liquid may enter the gaseous phase, whilst evaporation occurs only at the surface

##C
* **Coronary Blood Flow** at rest is **~5%** of CO, or 225 ml.min<sup>-1</sup>, and may increase **3-4x** during exercise.

* **Colligative Properties** are the properties of a solution that depend on the ratio of solute to solvent, and not on the type of moelcules present. These include:
  * Vapour pressure
  * Boiling point
  * Freezing point
  * Osmotic pressure


        
* **Critical Length**  
The length of axon which must be blocked in order to prevent action potential transmission. It is dependent on myelination and fibre diameter.

##G
* **General anaesthesia**  
Controlled production of unconsciousness.

##S
* **Saturated Vapour**  
Vapour which is in equilibrium with its own liquid state, i.e. there are as many molecules entering the vapour phase as there there are those condensing into the liquid phase.
    * A saturated vapour contains the least amount of energy possible without condensing


* **Saturated Vapour Pressure**  
Pressure exerted by a vapour which is in equilibrium with its liquid state. Increases with temperature, since as the kinetic energy (heat) content of molecules increase, more of them enter the vapour phase.
