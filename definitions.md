# Definitions

##A
* **Absorption**  
The rate at which a drug leaves its site of administration and the extent to which this occurs.

* **Acid**  
A proton donor.

* **Acidaemia**  
Arterial blood pH < 7.35.

* **Acidosis**  
A process which leads to an excess of hydrogen ions, and *may* lead to acidaemia if there is inadequate compensation. Can be subdivided into:
    * **Respiratory acidosis**: PaCO<sub>2</sub> > 45
    * **Metabolic alkalosis**: HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> < 22

* **Activity**  
The *effective* concentration of a substance in a reacting system

* **Adiabatic**  
A process that occurs without transfer of heat or matter. For example, gases heat up when compressed (greater than the energy used to compress them), and cool when allowed to expand (adiabatic cooling).

* **Affinity**  
Ability of a drug to bind to a receptor.

* **Afterload**
Sum of impedances to ventricular ejection.

* **Agonist**  
Drug which produces a maximal response at receptor site.

**Alkalaemia**  
Arterial blood pH > 7.45.

**Alkalosis**  
A process which leads to a deficit of hydrogen ions, and *may* lead to alkalaemia if there is inadequate compensation. Can be subdivided into:
    * **Respiratory acidosis**: PaCO<sub>2</sub> < 35
    * **Metabolic alkalosis**: HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> > 26


AMPLITUDE LINEARITY - amplifications of the signal should be equal throughout the entire signal range to prevent distortion.

ANAESTHESIA - without sensation.
-General: controlled production of unconsciousness

ANALOGUE SIGNAL - where the output of the transducer in either volts or amps varies directly with the input signal

ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) - approval to test 
for > 2 groups 

 ANAPHYLAXIS - clinical syndrome produced by IgE type I hypersensitivity resulting from antigen-antibody reaction at surface of mast cells. The syndrome manifests as red rash/flush, bronchospasm, collapse, angioedema, GIT symptoms. Requires prior exposure to antigen.

ANAPHYLACTOID REACTION - clinically indistinguishable from above but caused by complement activation or direct histamine release from mast cells.

ANION - negatively  charged ion

ANODE - positive electrode to which negative ions attract

ANREP EFFECT - intrinsic regulatory mechanism of the heart whereby an abrupt increase in afterload produces transient increase in  LVEPD and decrease in SV allowing prompt restoration to near baseline values. 

ANTAGONIST - interacts with receptor or other parts of effector mechanism to inhibit the action of an agonist, while initiating no effect themselves.

ATENUATE - reduce

ATPS - ambient temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapour  (T amb, Pb, PH2O)

AUTOREGULATION - ability of organ/body to maintain homeostasis in the presence of altering physiological conditions.

AVOGADROâ€™S HYPOTHESIS - equal volumes of different gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. One mole of any gas comprises 6.022 x 1023 molecules and occupies 22.4 L at STP

AZEOTROPE - a mixture of two substances that cannot be separated by fractional distillation given each component shares same boiling point (the boiling point of each is altered by the presence of the other). eg  mixture of ether and halothane in the ratio of  1:2

* **Coronary Blood Flow** at rest is **~5%** of CO, or 225 ml.min<sup>-1</sup>, and may increase **3-4x** during exercise.

* **Colligative Properties** are the properties of a solution that depend on the ratio of solute to solvent, and not on the type of moelcules present. These include:
  * Vapour pressure
  * Boiling point
  * Freezing point
  * Osmotic pressure
