# Insulin, Glucagon, and Somatostatin
> Describe the physiology of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin.

##Insulin
Insulin is a **polypeptide** hormone synthesised in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of **B cells** in the **Islets of Langerhans**. It is synthesised from **proinsulin**, excreted via exocytosis, and has a circulatory **half-life** of **~5min**. Insulin has **minimal protein binding** and a **tiny volume of distribution** (V<sub>D</sub> 0.075 L.kg<sup>-1</sup>, increased to 0.146 L.kg<sup>-1</sup> in diabetics). It is **metabolised** in liver, muscle, and kidney **by glutathione insulin transhydrogenase**, with renal elimination of inactive metabolites.

###Actions of Insulin
Insulin binds to a specific insulin receptor (a membrane-spanning protein composed of α and β subunits)  on the cell membrane. The complex is internalised, and has its effects by way of tyrosine kinase activity.

||Seconds|Minutes|Hours|
|--|--|--|--|
|**Muscle**|Increased glucose, amino acid, ketone, and K<sup>+</sup> uptake|Increased anabolism, decreased catabolism||
|**Fat**|Increased glucose, amino acid, and K<sup>+</sup> uptake|Increased glycerol phosphate synthesis|Increased fatty acid synthesis|
|**Liver**||Decreased: gluconeogenesis, decreased ketogenesis. Increased: glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, protein synthesis, lipid synthesis||
|**General**|||Increased cell growth|

###Glucose Tolerance
Hyperglycaemia occurs in diabetes due to **decreased peripheral utilisation** as a glucose uptake is reduced due to absence of or resistance to insulin. In addition, the suppressive effect of insulin on hepatic gluconeogenesis is absent or reduced. 

##Glucagon
Glucagon is a **polypeptide** hormone synthesised in the **A cells** of the pancreas. It has a circulating **half-life** of **~5min**, and is metabolised predominantly in the liver. It is secreted directly into the portal vein, and **undergoes first-pass metabolism** resulting in low circulating levels.

|System|Effect|
|--|--|
|**Liver**|Glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, glucose release, ketone formation|
|**CVS**| Inotropy|
|**Fat**|Lipolysis|
|**Metabolic**|Increased metabolic rate, GH release, somatosatin release, insulin release|

Secretion of glucagon is influenced by a number of factors:

|Stimulate Release|Inhibit Release|
|--|--|
|Hypoglycaemia and starvation|Somatostatin|
|Amino acids|Secretin
|Physiological stress: Exercise, infection|Free Fatty Acids|
|β-agonists|α-agonists
|Cortisol|Insulin|
|ACh|Ketones|
|Theophylline|GABA|

##Somatostatin
Somatostatin is a **polypeptide** that inhibits secretion of glucagon, insulin, and other pancreatic peptides. It may also function as a neurotransmitter in the CNS.
