# Adrenoreceptors
> Understand the pharmacology of adrenoreceptor blocking drugs.

*This covers the pharmacology of adrenoreceptors. The production and metabolism of endogenous catecholamines is covered under [adrenal hormones](adrenal-hormones.md). Detailed information on specific sympathomimetic agents is in the [pharmacopeia](adrenergic_drugs.md).*

Adrenoreceptors are classified by their varying sensitivity to different catecholamines. Additionally:
* All adrenoreceptors are G protein-coupled receptors
  * Each receptor contains seven transmembrane α-helical subunits, three extracellular loops, and three intracellular loops
* Alpha receptors have different subunits and mechanisms of action
* **All beta receptors** are:
  * G<sub>s</sub> coupled
  * Activate adenylate cyclase increasing cAMP, leading to increased Na<sup+</sup>/K<sup+</sup> ATPase activity and hyperpolarisation


##Adrenoreceptor Subtypes
**α<sub>1</sub>-receptors**:
  * Are present in smooth muscle  
  Agonism causes vasoconstriction, relaxation of GIT muscle (via presynaptic receptors), and contruction of GU muscle.
  * They are:
    * G<sub>q</sub> coupled
    * Phospholipase C activated increases IP<sub>3</sub>, increase calcium

**α<sub>2</sub>-receptors**:
  * Are present in the CNS, arterioles, pancreas  
  Agonism causes sedation, analgesia, vasodilatation, and inhibition of insulin release.
  * They are:
    * G<sub>i</sub> coupled
    * Inhibits adenylate cyclase, decreasing cAMP

**β<sub>1</sub>-receptors**:
  * Are present in cardiac muscle and the JGA
    * Cardiac agonism increases inotropy, chronotropy, and dromotropy
    * JGA agonism increases renin release
  * Increase in cAMP increases intracellular calcium

**β<sub>2</sub>-receptors**:
  * Are present in skeletal vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, the liver, and on cell membranes  
  * Agonism causes:
    * Vasodilation and bronchodilation
    * Hepatic glycogenolysis
    * Increases activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump, increasing intracellular potassium
  * Increase in cAMP increases Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity and hyperpolarisation

**β<sub>3</sub>-receptors**:
  * Are present in fat  
  Agonism causes lipolysis and thermogenesis.
