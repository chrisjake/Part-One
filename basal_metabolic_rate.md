> Outline the factors that influence metabolic rate

Basal Metabolic Rate is the **energy output required to sustain life at rest**. 'Resting' is defined as an individual who is:
* Fasted for 12 hours
* In a comfortable external environment
* At mental and physical rest 

Normal values are 100W.day<sup>-1</sup>, or 70kcal.hr<sup>-1</sup>.

Metabolic rate is the actual energy consumption of an individual.

##Factors Affecting Metabolic Rate
Metabolic Rate is affected by:
* **Age**
    * BMR declines with increasing age
        * Neonates have a BMR twice that of an adult
        * Children have an increased BMR relative to that of an adult
        * BMR declines by 2% for each decade of life
* Body Composition  
Lean muscle has a greater energy requirement than fat.
    * Higher body fat percentage results in a lower BMR
        * Females have a lower BMR for this reason - when adjusted for lean mass there is no difference
* Diet
    * Digestion increases BMR by ~10% due to the energy required to assimilate nutrients  
    This is known as the **specific dynamic action** of food.
        * Protein > carbohydrate > fat  
        Note that the Specific Dynamic Action for each macromolecule is not related to the respiratory quotient for that food type.            
    * Starvation decreases the BMR
* Exercise
    * Skeletal muscle is the largest and most variable source of energy consumption
* Environment
    * Cooler environments increase BMR 
    * Temperate environments decrease BMR up to 10%
* Physiological states
    * Pregnancy increases BMR up to 20% in 2nd and 3rd trimester
    * Lactation increases BMR
    * Catecholamines increase BMR
    * Corticosteroids increase BMR
* Disease states
    * Malignancy increases BMR
    * Sepsis increases BMR
    * Hyperthyroidism increases BMR    

##Measurement of BMR using Indirect Calorimetry
BMR is measured using **indirect calorimetry**, which calculates heat production via measurement of VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub>. A number of methods exists depending on whether the patient is intubated or not, or whether they are requring supplementary oxygen.

In general:
* Patients should be relaxed and fasted
* FiO<sub>2</sub> needs to be calculated (or taken from the ventilator settings), and E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>T</sub>O<sub>2</sub> must be measured
* Steady-state should be achieved across a five minute period
    * The average MVO<sub>2</sub> and MVCO<sub>2</sub> changes by <10%
    * The respiratory quotient ($$ RQ = { VCO_2 \over VO_2 }$$) change by <5%
        * This ratio will vary depending on the substances metabolised:
            * Carbohydrates = 1
            * Protein ≈ 0.8
            * Fat ≈ 0.7

Resting Energy Expenditure is given by the abbreviated Weir equation:

$$ REE = 3.94 \times (FiO_2 - E_TO_2 ) + (1.1 \times VCO_2) $$ in Watts per unit time of measurement.

###Errors in Indirect Calorimetry
* Air leaks and measurement errors
* Measures consumption (rather than requirements)
* Point estimate of a dynamic process

##Footnotes
The **respiratory quotient** is the value of $$ VCO_2 \over VO_2 $$ at steady-state, whilst the **respiratory exchange ratio** is affected by metabolic rate.
