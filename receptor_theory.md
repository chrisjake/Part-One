A **receptor** is a component of a cell which interacts with a drug and **initiates a sequence of events leading to an observed change in function**.
* Existence of receptors is inferred from the response of tissues to drugs, genome sequencing, and molecular biology.
* A drug binds to a receptor forming a **receptor-drug complex**, which initiates a cascade of events to exert a pharmacological effect. 

##Receptor-Drug Interaction
###Dissociation Constants
Interaction between a receptor and a drug is based upon the **law of mass action**, which states the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the masses of reacting substances. This can be expressed as:  
$$ [Drug] + [Receptor] â‡Œ [Drug-Receptor] $$

The ratio of the **rate constant** for the forwards reaction (**K<sub>association</sub>**) and the backwards reaction (**K<sub>dissociation</sub>**) is the **dissociation constant**. This is the concentration of drug when 50% of receptors are occupied:

$$ K_D = {[D][R] \over [D-R]} $$

A **low K<sub>D</sub>** value indicates that a lower concentration of drug is required to occupy 50% of the receptor, indicating that the drug has a **high affinity** for the receptor.

Physiological factors which affect the dissociation constant are determined by the **Arrhenius equation**:

$$ k = Ae^{-E_A \over RT} $$, where:
* $$A$$ is a constant
* $$T$$ is **temperature** in kelvin
* $$E_A$$ is the activation energy required, which may be lowered by a **catalyst**
* $$R$$ is the gas constant

###Properties of Drugs
Key properties of drugs include:
* **Potency**  
The **amount** of drug required to have an effect (typically the EC<sub>50</sub>).
    * This relates to **Bowman's principle**, which states that the **least potent** anaesthetic agents have the **quickest onset**  
    This is because they are administered in **higher doses** (as they are less potent, more is required to get an effect), which results in a **high concentration gradient** and a **rapid distribution** into tissues.


* **Efficacy**  
The **maximal** effect that a drug can generate.


* **Intrinsic activity**  
The size of effect a drug has when bound, which is graded from 0 to 1. This allows drugs to be subdivided into:
    * **Agonists**
    * **Antagonists**
    * **Partial agonists**
    * **Inverse agonists**.

####Agonist
An agonist will generate a **maximal** response at the receptor site. An agonist has **high affinity** and an **activity of 1**. Agonists can be compared by:
* **Relative potency** implies that if two agonists are equally efficacious, a smaller dose of one is required to get an effect.
* **Relative efficacy** implies that the maximal effect of one agonist is greater than the other.

####Antagonist 
An antagonist produces no response at the receptor site, and prevents other ligands binding. Antagonists have **high affinity** and an **activity of 0**.

Antagonists with these properties are also known as **direct antagonists**, which can be either:
* **Competitive antagonists**  
Displace other ligands from a binding site. The effect can be overriden by increasing the dose of agonist.
* **Non-competitive antagonists**  
Create a conformational change in the receptor. They cannot be overidden by increasing the dose of agonist.

Other mechanisms of drug antagonism exist, which work in a more roundabout fashion. These are classed **indirect antagonists**, and include:
* **Chemical antagonists**  
Where the drug binds directly to another. Examples include protamine and heparin, and sugammadex and rocuronium.
* **Physiologic antagonists**  
A countering effect is produced by agonism of other pathways.

####Partial agonist
A partial agonist generates a **submaximal** response at the receptor. A partial agonist has a **high affinity** and an **activity between 0 and 1**. A partial agonist can act as an effective antagonist in the presence of a full agonist, as it will prevent maximal binding at a receptor, even with a high agonist concentration.

####Inverse agonist 
A drug which has a **negative activity** (between 0 and -1) producing the **opposite** response (compared to the endogenous agonist) at receptor.
* Occurs due to loss of **constitutive activity** at that receptor
