> Describe the physiology and biochemistry of fat~~, carbohydrate and protein~~ metabolism

##Digestion
Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in animals and vegetables, and therefore in dietary fat. They consist of **three fatty acid** molecules joined by a **glycerol molecule**.

As fats are not water soluble, they tend to clump together in chyme and are hard to digest (due to the low surface area:volume ratio). Emulsification speeds up the digestive process and occurs in a number of ways:
* Bile salts  
  Many bile salts have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic end, which give a detergent action. Bile salts bound to fatty acids form a **mixed micelle** which can be digested by digestive enzymes or absorbed directly.
* Partially digested fats 
* Mechanical action of the stomach

Once emulsified, triglycerides can be hydrolysed by **lipase** into fatty acids and monoacylglycerol.

##Absorption
Mixed micelles, free fatty acids, and monoacylgylcerol, and cholesterols are absorbed via facilitated diffusion into the enterocyte. From the enterocyte, short chain fatty acids (those with < 12 carbon atoms) enter the portal vein and travel directly to the liver. 

Other fatty acids are re-esterified( which maintains the concentration gradient, allowing further uptake) and packaged with a layer of **protein** and **cholesterol** to form a ** chylomicron**, which are ejected from the cell into the lymphatics. On reaching the systemic circulation they are absorbed into the lymphatic system.

Chylomicrons are removed from circulation by **lipoprotein lipase**, which is located on capillary endothelium and bound to albumin. Lipoprotein lipase, using **heparin** as a **cofactor**, breaks down triglylceride in chylomicrons and VLDL to free fatty acids and glycerol, which are then free to enter adipose tissue

##Storage
Fat is stored as **trigylcerides**, and forms the bulk of energy storage of the body.

Triglycerides are synthesised by the liver when insulin levels are high and glycogen stores are full. Excess carbohydrate and amino acids are converted to fatty acids and glycerol, and then esterified to form triglyceride - a process known as lipogenesis.

##Metabolism
Free fatty acids can be absorbed by adiopocytes for storage, or be **Î²-oxidised to acetyl CoA** in the liver, which can enter the citric acid cycle to produce ATP.
