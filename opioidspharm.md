#Opioids
Key definitions:
* **Opiates** are all naturally-occurring substances with morphine-like properties
* **Opioids** is a general term for substances with an affinity for opioid receptors
* **Opium** is a mixture of alkaloids from the poppy plant

##Classification of Opioids
* **Naurally occurring**  
    * Endogenous opioids
        * Endorphins
        * Encephalins
        * Dynorphins
    * Opium derivatives
    * Phenanthrenes
        * Morphine
        * Codeine
* **Semisynthetic**  
Simple modifications to morphine.
    * Diacetylmorphine
    * Buprenorphine
    * Oxycodone
* **Synthetic**
    * Phenylpiperidines
        * Fentanyl
        * Alfentanil
        * Remiphentanil
        * Pethidine
    * Diphenylpropylamines
        * Methadone

##Opioid Receptor Classification
All opioid receptors are Gi receptors. Activation:
* Increases adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP
    * Presynaptically inhibits voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels
        * Decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx
        * Reduces neurotransmitter release
    * Post-synaptically stimulates acivates K<sup>+</sup> channels
        * Causes K<sup>+</sup> efflux
        * Leads to membrane hyperpolarisation

|Receptor|Actions|Notable Properties
|--|--|
|MOP|Analgesia (spinal and brain), euphoria, meiosis (via stimulation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus), nausea and vomiting (via CTZ), sedation, bradycardia, inhibition of gut motility, urinary retention, physical dependence|Only opioid receptor to cause nausea/vomiting
|KOP|Analgesia (predominantly spinal), sedation, meiosis, dysphoria|Less respiratory depression
|DOP|Analgesia, respiratory depression, urinary retention, physical dependence|Minimal constipation
|NOP|Anxiety, depression, change in appetite|Hyperalgesia at low doses, analgesic at high doses

Mechanism of effects:
* **Respiratory depression**  
Decreases central chemoreceptor sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>.
* **Constipation**  
Stimulation of opioid receptors in the gut.
    * Normally activated by local endogenous opioids (used as neurotransmitters)
    * Agonism of these receptors (µ, k, and to a smaller extent, δ) reduces GIT secretions and peristalsis
