An action potential is a propagating change in the membrane potential of an excitable cell, used in cellular communication and to initiate intracellular processes. It is caused by altering the permeability of a membrane to different ions.

##Pacemaker Potential
This pattern of electrical activity is seen in the SA and AV nodes. It  **has no resting state**, and is continually depolarising.

###Phases of the Pacemaker Potential
* **Phase 0**  
  At the threshold potential of **-40mV**, voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open, causing an inward movement of ions. The membrane potential peaks at **20mV**.
* **Phase 3**  
  Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels close and K<sup>+</sup> channels open, leading to repolarisation. The nadir is called the **maximum diastolic potential** and is -**65mV**.
* **Phase 4**  
  The funny curent is a mixed Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> current which gradually depolarises the cell.
    * Sympathetic stimulation increases the funny current, increasing the rate of depolarisation.
    * Parasympathetic stimulation increases K<sup>+</sup> permeability, hyperpolarising the cell and flattens the gradient of phase 4.


##Ventricular Action Potential
To prevent tetanic contraction (which would be bad) ventricular muscle has a long plateau prior to repolarisation, which lengthens the absolute refractory period to 250ms. The relative refractory period is 50ms.

###Phases of the Ventricular Action Potential
* **Phase 0**: Depolarisation  
  At the threshold potential, voltage-gated **fast-Na<sup>+</sup>** channels open briefly, causing depolarisation. The membrane potential peaks at **30mV**.
* **Phase 1**: Partial Repolarisation  
  The closure of Na<sup>+</sup> channels results in K<sup>+</sup> fleeing the cell down its electrochemical gradient, causing a slight drop in voltage called partial repolarisation.
* **Phase 2**: Plateau  
  **L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels** open, causing a slow inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current which maintains depolarisation and facilitates muscle contraction.
* **Phase 3**: Repolarisation  
  Membrane permeability normalises, and outward potassium current returns the membrane potential to normal.
* **Phase 4**: Resting Potential  
  Membrane potential returns to its resting **-85mV**.

##Propagation of the Cardiac Action Potential
Pacemaker cells are responsible for automaticity and rhythmicity of the heart. The fastest pacemaker is the focus for myocardial conduction, and is typically the SA node. Should the SA node fail, the next fastest pacemaker will take over. This provides an element of redundancy.

* **Atrial Conduction**  
  From the SA node, the impulse travels at ~1m.s<sup>-1</sup>, depolarising the atria.

* **AV node**  
  The AV node is the only (normal) site of connection between the atria and ventricles. The AV node transmits with a delay of 0.1s, allowing time for atrial contraction to finish before ventricular contraction begins. AV nodal cells have a prolonged refractory period and cannot conduct more than **220** impulses per minute.

    The refractory period is prolonged by vagal stimulation, which increases potassium permeability and hyperpolarises the cell. Conversely, sympathetic stimulation increases calcium permeability and allows more rapid transmission.
    
    The AV node conducts via three pathways:
    * Bachmann Pathway  
    Also conducts to the LA.
    * Wenckebach pathway
    * Thorel pathway


* **Ventricular Conduction**  
  From the AV node, the signal via the bundle of His to the right and left bundles, and then to the Purkinje fibres which conduct at 1-4m.s<sup>-1</sup>. Endocardium, papillary muscle and septum contract first, followed by apex, followed by the chambers. Purkinje fibres have a long refractory period and can act as a pacemaker at 30-40 bpm.

##Autonomic Control
* **Parasympathetic Innervation**  
    * SA node by right vagus  
    There is continual PNS input ("Vagal tone") via inhibitory ACh GPCR, reducing the SA node from its intrinsic rate of 90-120bpm.
    * AV node by left vagus
    * Atria is innervated by parasympathetic neurons, ventricle is not. Therefore **PNS stimulation has little effect on inotropy, but does affect chronotropy**.


* **Sympathetic Innervation**  
    * SNS activity causes release of noradrenaline (at post-ganglionic synapse) and adrenaline from adrenal medulla which stimulate cardiac β<sub>1</sub> receptors causing:
        * Positive chronotropy at the SA node
        * Positive inotropy at ventricular muscle
        * Shorter action potential duration (due to opening of rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels
        * Increased AV conduction

###Cardiac Transplant
The transplanted heart has no vagal/parasympathetic innervation but still expresses β<sub>1</sub> receptors, so it:
* Defaults to a resting heart rate of ~100bpm
* Highly preload dependent as cannot respond quickly to changes in SVR
* Not responsive to parasympatholytics (atropine, glycopyrrolate) or ephedrine (as this is indirectly-acting) to increase chronotropy - isoprenaline may be used.
* Gradual response to demands in exercise (lacks local SNS innervation, but will still respond to circulating catecholamines)
* Increased sensitivity to catecholamines due to increased expression of β<sub>1</sub> receptors
