# Anticoagulants

**Warfarin** prevents the the return of vitamin K to its reduced form, and therefore the gamma-carboxylation of vitamin-K dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X), as well as Protein C and Protein S). This prevents these clotting factors binding to endothelium.

**Heparin** is a mucopolysaccharide organic acid which occurs naturally in the liver and in mast cells. It has a highly variable molecular weight between 5,000 and 25,000 Da. Heparin accelerates the rate of formation of the (inactive) antithrombin-thromin complex, reducing circulating thrombin. It also inhibits factor Xa, and (in higher concentrations) IXa, XIa, XIIa, and platelet aggregation.

##HITTs
**Heparin-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia** comes in two flavours:
* **Type I** is:
    * Non-immune mediated
    * Occurs within 4 days of anticoagulant doses
    * Is an isolated thrombocytopenia without clinical significance
* **Type II** is:
    * Immune mediated
    * Occurs within 4-14 days
    * Is associated with serious thrombosis and high mortality (typically from PE) and morbidity (from CVA nad limb ischaemia)
