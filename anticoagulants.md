#Anticoagulants {#id}
    
|Property|Warfarin|Heparin|Enoxaparin
|--|--|
|**Uses**|AF, DVT/PE, Prosthetic Valves|AF, DVT/PE, Extra-corporeal Circuit Anticoagulation|DVT Prophylaxis
|**Pharmaceutics**|Marevan and coumadin may *potentially* have different bioavailabilities (it has not been assessed) and so should not be substituted|Mucopolysaccharide organic acid which occurs naturally in the liver and in mast cells, with a highly variable molecular weight (between 5,000 and 25,000 Da)|Smaller fragments of heparin (prepared from UFH), with a mean molecular weight of 5,000 Da|
|**Mechanism of Action**|Prevents the return of vitamin K to its reduced form, and therefore the gamma-carboxylation of vitamin-K dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X), as well as Protein C and Protein S).|Accelerates the rate of formation of the (inactive) antithrombin-thrombin complex, reducing circulating thrombin. <br><br> Heparin also inhibits factor Xa, and (in higher concentrations) IXa, XIa, XIIa, and platelet aggregation.|Potentiates the action of ATIII, increasing inhibition of Xa (and to a lesser extent IIa)
|**Onset**|8-12 hours. Peak at 72 hours due to the half-life of existing clotting factors, and the total body stores of vitamin K|
|**Absorption**|100% bioavailability|-|-|
|**Distribution**|99% protein bound|Low lipid solubility, highly protein bound|Does not bind to heparin-binding proteins
|**Metabolism**|Complete hepatic mestabolism. Significant pharmacokinetic|Hepatic interactions due to enzymatic induction (ETOH, amiodarone, salicylates, NSAIDs) and inhibition (OCP, barbiturates, carbamazepine)|Renal elimination of metabolites
|**Elimination**|Faecal and renal elimination of metabolites|Renal of inactive metabolites|Renal of active drug and inactive metabolites
|**CVS**|Microthrombi|Hypotension with rapid IV administration||
|**Metabolic**||Osteoporosis||
|**Haeme**|Haemorrhage|Haemorrhage, HITTs|Haemorrhage, lower risk of HITTs than UFH
|**Immune**|Hypersensitivity reactions|||
|**Reversal**|- Waiting<br>- Vitamin K<br>- FFP<br>- Prothrombinex|Reversed with protamine (1mg per 100U).|Incomplete reversal with protamine.|
|**Other**|Teratogenic. Complicated pharmacokinetics requiring monitoring using INR|Requires monitoring with APTT or ATIII levels. Large interpatient variability due to variable amounts of ATIII.|No monitoring required. |


##HITTs
**Heparin-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia** comes in two flavours:
* **Type I** is:
    * Non-immune mediated
    * Occurs within 4 days of anticoagulant doses
    * Is an isolated thrombocytopenia without clinical significance
* **Type II** is:
    * Immune mediated
    * Occurs within 4-14 days
    * Is associated with serious thrombosis and high mortality (typically from PE) and morbidity (from CVA nad limb ischaemia)
