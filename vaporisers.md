#Vaporisers

> <p style="color:purple";> Describe the principles and safe operation of vaporisers </p>

Delivery of gas that is fully saturated with anaesthetic agent would result in lethal doses being administered. The use of a vaporiser allows a safe dose of anaesthetic agent to be given. Vaporisers can be divided into:
* Variable bypass vaporisers  
Air that is fully saturated with gas is mixed with a 'bypass' stream of gas, diluting the delivered concentration. Further subdivided into:
	* Plenum  
	Requires supra-atmospheric pressure to operate.
    	* More accurate
	* Draw-over  
	Driven by the patients inspiratory effort.
	    * Portable


##Variable Bypass Vaporiser
Variable bypass vaporisers aim to deliver the same concentration of anaesthetic agent over a range of flows. They achieve this by:
* Flow management
    * Baffles and wicks increase the surface area of the liquid/gas interface, increasing and the rate of vaporisation (which may still be exceeded by the gas flow rate)  
    These are less effective in draw-over vaporisers, as resistance must be minimised.
* Temperature management  
SVP of volatile agents increase non-linearly as temperature increases. Temperature changes:
	* Occur through:
		* Changes in ambient temperature
		* Loss through latent heat of vaporisation  
		Liquid agent from the vaporiser will cool over the course of an anaesthetic.
	* Are managed with:
		* Temperature stabilisation  
		Use of materials with both a high thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity allow the vaporising chamber to buffer changes in surrounding temperature.
		* Temperature compensation  
		Adjusts flow into either the vaporising chamber or bypass chamber to account for changes in environmental temperature. Methods include:
			* Bimetallic strip  
			Metal strip which bends in response to environmental temperature, adjusting the amount of gas entering the vaporising chamber.
			* Aneroid bellows  
			Connect to a cone in the opening of the bypass chamber. As temperature decreases, the bellows contract and the cone partially obstructs the bypass channel.

###Difference Between Plenum and Draw-Over Vaporisers
Plenum vaporisers are:
* More accurate  
Designed to deliver accurate agent concentrations over a wide range (0.25-15L.min<sup>-1</sup>) of flow rates
    * Below 250ml.min<sup>-1</sup> the resistance of the flow splitting valve becomes more significant, causing the amount of gas in the bypass stream to be higher than intended
    * Above 15L.min<sup>-1</sup> gas may not be fully saturated
* Heavier  
Typically built of metals such as copper to maximise thermal stability.
* High internal resistance 
	* Must be used out-of-circle
	* Must be used with positive-pressure

Draw-Over Vaporisers are:
* Less accurate
	* Less use of baffles and wicks to minimise inspiratory resistance
* Less thermally stable
	* Oxford Minature Vaporiser does not have a bimetallic strip
	* Oxford Minature Vaporiser uses glycol as a thermal buffer


##Measured Flow Vaporisers
Measured flow vaporisers have a separate stream of agent-saturated gas that is added to the gas flow. This requires the device to:
* Measure fresh gas flow rate
* Adjust vapour-gas flow rate so the desired concentration is delivered

This system is used for the delivery of desflurane, as desflurane:
* Has a very high SVP  
Requires high bypass flow rate to dilute to a clinically useful concentration.
* Has a low boiling point  
Intermittently boils at room temperature, which will cause large fluctuations in delivery:
	* Excessive agent delivery during boiling  
	This will lead to cooling due to the latent heat of vaporisation.
	* Cooled desflurane will have a much lower saturated vapour pressure  
	Significant under-delivery will then occur.

The Tec6 vaporiser:
* Heats desflurane to 39°C  
SVP of desflurane at this tempeature is 1500mmHg.
* Gaseous desflurane is then added to the fresh gas flow  
The amount added depends on:
	* Desired concentration
	* Fresh gas flow rate  
	As flow increases the resistance to flow of desflurane vapour decreases. 

##General Safety Features of Vapourisers
Agent specificity:
* Key indexed filling
* Pin indexed safety system connectors
* Colour coding of unit and agent containers

Single agent administration:
* Interlock mechanism  
Prevents multiple vaporisers being turned on.
* Single cartridge slot (Aladdin system)

Tipping and overfilling:
* Long vaporization chamber inflow
* Heavy construction
* Transport modes
* Side filling and overflow ports

Anti-pumping:
* Check valves and long vaporization chamber inflow prevent entrainment of vaporizer gas in the inflow of the bypass channel

Agent depletion:
* Filling gauges
* Low pressure alarms (Tec 6)

##Other Factors Affecting Vaporisers
Carrier Gas Composition:
* Nitrous oxide and air are more viscous than oxygen
* This leads to decreased flow through the vaporising chamber when FiO<sub>2</sub> is low  
This effect is not clinically significant.

Altitude:
* Clinical effect of volatile agent is a function of their partial pressure in tissues
* As SVP is independent of atmospheric pressure, this is unchanged at altitude
* A vaporiser set at 2% will deliver 4% gas at 0.5atm pressure, however as the atmospheric pressure is reduced the same partial pressure of vapour is delivered

* The delivered concentration of an agent at altitude is given by the equation:  
$$ Delivered \ Concentration (%) = Intended \ Concentration \times {P_{cal} \over P_{alt}}$$, where:
* $$ Actual \ Delivered \ Concentration$$ is the concentration of agent in the gas delivered to the patient  
This must be multipled by the atmospheric pressure to find the partial pressure of agent delivered to the patient.
* $$ Intended \ Concentration$$ is the concentration dialed up on the vaporiser
* $$ P_{cal}$$ is the atmospheric pressure where the vaporiser was calibrated
* $$ P_{alt}$$ is the atmosopheric pressure where the vaporiser is being used
