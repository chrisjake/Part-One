#Vaporisers

> <p style="color:purple";> Describe the principles and safe operation of vaporisers </p>

Vaporisers can be divided into:
* Plenum  
Requires supra-atmospheric pressure to operate.
    * More accurate
* Draw-over 
Driven by the patients inspiratory effort.
    * Portable

##Plenum Vaporiser
Plenum vaporisers are designed to deliver accurate agent concentrations over a wide range (0.25-15L.min<sup>-1</sup>) of flow rates. They achieve this by:
* Flow management
    * Baffles and wicks increase the surface area of the liquid/gas interface, increasing and the rate of vaporisation (which may still be exceeded by the gas flow rate)
    * Below 250ml.min<sup>-1</sup> resistance of the flow splitting valve increases , causing the amount of gas in the bypass stream to be higher than intended
* Temperature management  
SVP of volatile agents increases non-linearly as temperature increases.


Agent specificity
- key indexed filling
- pin indexed safety system connectors
- colour coding of unit and agent containers

Single agent administration
- interlock mechanism
- single cartridge slot (Aladdin system)

Temperature management (heat of vaporization and changes in ambient temperature necessary as SVP changes will affect agent partial pressure)
- heavy construction with materials of high specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity
- dynamic temperature adjustment via a thermally expanding element, a bimetallic strip or an electronic control system

Flow management


Tipping and overfilling
- long vaporization chamber inflow
- heavy-based construction
- transport modes
- side filling and overflow ports

Anti-pumping
- check valves and long vaporization chamber inflow prevent entrainment of vaporizer gas in the inflow of the bypass channel

Agent depletion
- filling gauges
- low pressure alarms (Tec 6)
