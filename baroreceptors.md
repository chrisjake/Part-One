#Baroreceptors {#id}
> Describe the function of baroreceptors and to relate this knowledge to common clinical situations.

Baroreceptors are **stretch receptors** which monitor changes in arterial pressure. **Arterial pressure** is monitored by receptors in the:
* **Aortic arch**  
  * Innervated by CNX
* **Carotid sinus**    
Small dilation of the ICA at the level of the bifurcation.
  * Innervated by CNIX
  * Remember the carotid *sinus* is a baroreceptor, the carotid *body* is a chemoreceptor


**Low-pressure** stretch receptors:
  * Respond to increased venous return
  * Are inhibited by positive pressure ventilation
  * Act by stretch and typically described as **volume receptors**
  * Are located in the:
    * **Atrial walls**
    * **SVC and IVC**  
    * **Pulmonary circulation**


##Baroreceptor Control
Afferent fibres from CNIX and CNX travel to the NTS in the **medulla**. Effector neurons from the RVLM are GABAergic and therefore inhibitory, i.e. increased baroreceptor discharge *reduces* tonic sympathetic tone and increases vagal tone.

**Increased baroreceptor activity** therefore **results in:**
* Arterial and venous vasodilation
* Hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Decreased cardiac output
* Decreased respiratory rate

**Increased** **low-pressure** stretch receptor activity results in an **increase** rather than a decrease in **heart rate**.

##Baroreceptor Activity
Baroreceptors are:
* **More sensitive to pulsatile pressure** than constant pressure  
A decrease in pulse pressure without a change in MAP will decrease baroreceptor firing.
* Active throughout the cardiac cycle  
Rapid compensatory responses are vital in the short-term control of blood pressure, e.g. with posture.
* Active over the range from 50mmHg to 200mmHg

This curve is left-shifted in children and neonates, and right-shifted in chronic hypertension, though this is reversible.

##Hormonal control
Atrial stretch receptors also excrete ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide), which reduces blood pressure in the following ways:
* Increased GFR  
  ANP constricts the efferent arteriole and dilates of the afferent arteriole. This subsequently inhibits renin secretion through increased hydrostatic pressure at the JGA and increased Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> delivery to the macula densa.
* Decreased aldosterone  
  ANP inhibits aldosterone secretion.
* Vasodilation  
  ANP causes vasodilation of peripheral smooth muscle.


Ventricular stretch receptors secrete BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide), which is similar to ANP and has similar function to ANP.
