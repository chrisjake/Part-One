#Baroreceptors {#id}
> Describe the function of baroreceptors and to relate this knowledge to common clinical situations.

Baroreceptors are **stretch receptors** which monitor changes in circulatory pressure. **Arterial pressure** is monitored by receptors in the **aortic arch** and **carotid sinus**, and respond to changes in pressure.

**Low-pressure** sensors exist in the **atrial walls**, at the entrance of the **SVC and IVC**, and in the **pulmonary circulation**. These receptors respond to an increase in venous return but are inhibited by positive pressure ventilation. Therefore they act by atrial stretch and typically described as **volume receptors**.

##Baroreceptor Control
The carotid sinus is a small dilation of the internal carotid at the bifurcation. Afferent fibres from the **carotid sinus** form a branch of the **glossopharyngeal nerve**. Afferent fibres from **aortic baroreceptors** in the wall of the vessel and **ventricular stretch receptors** form a branch of the **vagus nerve**.

Fibres from both travel to the NTS in the **medulla**. Effector neurons from the RVLM are GABAergic and therefore inhibitory, i.e. increased baroreceptor discharge *reduces* tonic sympathetic tone and increases vagal tone.

**Increased baroreceptor activity** therefore **results in:** arterial and venous vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, and decreased respiratory rate.

Increased **low-pressure** stretch receptor activity results in an increase rather than a decrease in heart rate.

##Baroreceptor Activity
The carotid sinus is active over the range from 50mmHg to 200mmHg. Baroreceptors are **more sensitive to pulsatile pressure** than constant pressure, so a decrease in pulse pressure without a change in MAP will decrease baroreceptor firing. They are active throughout the cardiac cycle and exhibit rapid compensatory responses. Consequently, they are vital in the short-term control of blood pressure as occurs with changes in position.

In chronic hypertension, the set point of the baroreceptor reflex is reset, though this is reversible.

##Hormonal control
Atrial stretch receptors also excrete ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide), which reduces blood pressure in the following ways:
* Increased GFR  
  ANP constricts the efferent arteriole and dilates of the afferent arteriole. This subsequently inhibits renin secretion through increasd hydrostatic pressure at the JGA and increased Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> delivery to the macula densa.
* Decreased aldosterone  
  ANP inhibits aldosterone secretion.
* Vasodilation  
  ANP causes vasodilation of peripheral smooth muscle.


Ventricular stretch receptors secrete BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide), which is similar to ANP and has similar function to ANP.
