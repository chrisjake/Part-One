##Receptor types
A receptor is a protein, usually in the cellular membrane, to which a ligand may bind to generate a response.

**Intracellular** receptors may be either **cytoplasmic** or **intra-nuclear**. Intranuclear receptors are activated by lipid soluble molecules (such as steroids and thyroxine) to alter DNA and RNA expression. This results in an alteration of production of cellular proteins, so the effects tend to be slow acting.

**Enzyme-linked** receptors are activated by a ligand and cause enzymatic activity on the intracellular side. They can be either **monomers** or **dimers** (where two proteins join, or diamerise, on binding of a ligand).

**Ion-channel** receptors (ionotropic) are able to create a channel through the membrane that allows electrolytes to flow down their electrical and concentration gradients. They can be **ligand-gated** or **voltage gated**.

* **Ligand-gated** channels undergo conformational change when a ligand is bound. There are three important families of ligand channels:
    * Pentameric family  
  Consist of five membrane spanning subunits. Include:
     * Nicotinic ACh receptor
     * GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
     * 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor
    * Inotropic glutamate
      Binds glutamate, a CNS excitatory neurotransmitter. Include:
     * NMDA receptor  
       High Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability
    * Inotropic purinergic receptors  
      Form cationic channels that are permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>  
      Activated by ATP


* **Voltage-gated** channels open when the **threshold voltage** is reached, and facilitate electrical conduction in excitable tissues.



**G-protein** coupled (metabotropic) receptors:
* G-proteins are a group of heterotrimeric (containing three units; α, β, γ) proteins which bind GDP  
When stimulated, the GDP is replaced by GTP and the α-GTP subunit dissociates to activate or inhibit an effector protein. The effect depends on the type of α-subunit:
  * G<sub>**s**</sub> proteins  
  Are **stimulatory**. These
    * Increase cAMP, leading to a biochemical effect.
  * G<sub>**i**</sub> proteins  
  Are **inhibitory**. These:
    * Inhibit adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP.  
  * G<sub>q</sub> proteins  
  Have a variable effect, depending on the cell. These:
    * Activate phospholipase C. This affects the production of:
      * Inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)  
      Stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the SR, affecting enzymatic function or causing membrane depolarisation.
      * Diacylglycerol (DAG)    
      Activates protein kinase C, which has cell-specfic effects.
* Activate intracellular **second messenger proteins** when stimulated  
Second messenger systems:
  * Result in both transmission and **amplification** of a stimulus, as a single activated receptor can activate multiple proteins and each activated protein may activate several other intermediate proteins
    * This is known as a G-protein **cascade**


##Enzyme interaction
Drugs can interact with enzymes by **antagonism** or by being a **false substrate**.

###Enzyme antagonism
Most drugs which interact with enzymes inhibit their activity. This results in:
* Increased concentration of enzymatic substrate
* Decreased concentration of the product of the reaction

Drugs can be competitive, non-competitive, or irreversible inhibitors of enzymatic activity. Examples include:
* Ramipril is a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme.
* Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase.

###False substrates
False substrates compete with the enzymatic binding site, and produce a product. Examples include:
* Methyldopa is a false substrate of the enzyme dopamine decarboxylase.

##Physicochemical
Drugs whose mechanism of action is due to their physicochemical properties. Examples include:
* Mannitol reduces ICP because it increases tonicity of the extracellular compartment (and is unable to cross the BBB), drawing free water from the intracellular compartment as a consequence.
* Aluminium hydroxide reacts with stomach acid to form aluminium chloride and water, reducing stomach pH.
