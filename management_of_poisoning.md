> Understanding of the general principles of poisoning and its management.

##Principles of management of poisoning:
#### **"Recognition-Resus-RSI-DEAD**"[^1]
* **Recognition**
    * Degree of emergency
    * Getting senior help
    * Application of 100% oxygen early


* **Resuscitation**
    * A: Control in any patient with significantly impaired conscious state
    * B: Oxygen if not previously applied. Mechanical ventilation if required.
    * C: Intravenous access is always required. Central venous access may be required.
    * D: Glucose level. Control seizures.
    * E: Control hypothermia


* **Risk assessment**
    * History including timing, amount, co-administered drugs, current patient status.    
* **Supportive care**
* **Investigations**
    * ECG
    * Invasive monitoring may be required if haemodynamics are unstable. 
    * Drug levels


* **Decontamination**
    * Activated charcoal *may* be appropriate if recent ingestion (<1 hour) and the airway is secured
* **Enhanced Elimination**
    * Used in severe poisoning when supportive care is likely to be inadequate. Includes:
      * Urinary alkalinisation
      * Filtration
* **Antidotes**
    * E.g. naloxone for opiates
* **Disposition**
