#Penicillins {#id}

* Penicillins are **bactericidal** antibiotics that prevent cell-wall synthesis by preventing cross-linking of peptidoglycans by replacing the natural substrate with their β-lactam ring
* Penicillins bind to penicillin binding proteins (**PBPs**) in the bacterial wall
* Penicillins only rarely achieve complete eradication of sensitive organisms without addition of a **synergistic antibiotic** (such as gentamicin)

##Common Features
|Property|Effect
|--|--|
|**Absorption**|Typically well absorbed orally. IM dosing tend to cause localised pain and irritation.|
|**Distribution**| Typically have good tissue penetration. Only cross the blood-brain barrier and enter bone if it is inflamed. Typically low protein binding (exception is flucloxacillin, which is 95% protein bound).|
|**Metabolism**| Typically small proportion is hepatically metabolised.
|**Elimination**| Majority (60-90%) is eliminated unchanged in urine, with a small proportion eliminated in bile.|

###Mechanisms of Resistance
* Alteration or protection of PBPs
  * Gram negative bacteria may have altered permeability of porins in their outer membrane, which protects the PDP
* Hydrolysis by **β-lactamase**-producing bacteria
  * **Clavulanic acid** and **tazobactam inhibit β-lactamase**, which can render otherwise resistant bacteria sensitive
  * Notably, flucloxacillin has a modified beta-lactam ring that is not sensitive to β-lactamases
