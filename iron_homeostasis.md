# Iron Homeostasis
>	Describe the normal nutritional requirements

Approximately 3-5g of iron is found in the body
* **Oxygen-carrying globin molecules** (~70%)  
Haemoglobin and myoglobin.
* **Catalyst** for biological reactions (~30%)  
Catalase, peroxidase, and cytochromes all require iron.

##Absorption
Dietary iron comes in two forms:
* Haeme groups  
Directly absorbed via specialised transport proteins.
* Dietary iron salts  
Only ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) can be absorbed by enterocytes. Ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) iron is reduced to ferric iron by stomach acid, which facilitates its absorption.
  * Reduced acidity of the stomach will reduce the absorption of ferrous iron


* Once in the enterocyte, iron can be:
  * Stored, bound to **ferritin**
  * Transported via **ferroportin** out of the enterocyte, where it is then oxidised to ferrous iron and bound to **transferrin**

##Regulation
* Excretion is uncontrolled
* Regulation of iron levels is only by absorption
* **Hepcidin** is a liver protein which inhibits the action of ferroportin
  * High hepcidin prevents iron transport from the enterocyte
  * Hepcidin is deficient in haemochromatosis
