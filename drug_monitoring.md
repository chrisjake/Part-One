#Drug Monitoring
> Explain clinical drug monitoring with regard to peak and trough concentrations, minimum therapeutic concentration and toxicity

Drug monitoring is the individualisation of dosing by maintainig plasma drug levels within a target range[^1]. Variability between patients in response can either be pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic. Adjusting drug dosing based on monitoring reduces pharmacokinetic variability.

Drug levels are measured to ensure the concentration is above the minimum therapeutic concentration but below toxic levels. 
* **Minimum therapeutic concentration** determines desired **trough levels**.   
  Minimum effective concentration is defined as the ED<sub>50</sub>, i.e. the dose required to have an effect in 50% of the population.
* **Minimum toxic concentration** determines the acceptable **peak levels**.  
  Minimum toxic concentration is defined as the LD<sub>50</sub>, or the dose which is lethal in 50% of the population.

The **therapeutic window** or **therapeutic range** is the **difference** between these levels. The **therapeutic index** is the **ratio** between these levels, i.e.

$$ Therapeutic \ Index = {LD_{50} \over ED_{50}} $$

A **higher therapeutic index** gives a **greater** margin for **safety**.

##Indications
Drugs are monitored to avoid **toxicity**, adjust dosing for **effiacy**, and **monitor** compliance or determine failure of therapy. Drugs where the effect can be measured clinically (e.g. antihypertensives) tend to be adjusted on a clinical basis, and do not require monitoring. Drugs that typically require monitoring have a:
* Narrow target range
* Significant pharmacokinetic variability
* Relationship between the concentration in plasma and clinical effets
* Determined concentration range
* Validated monitoring assay

Drugs where the effect can be measured clinically (e.g. antihypertensives) tend to be adjusted on a clinical basis. This is not possible when:
* The clinical response is the *absence* of a condition, e.g. antiepileptics
* The drug has a narrow therapeutic range


Drugs commonly monitored in the ICU setting include:

| Drug | Therapeutic Range |
| -- | -- |
| Digoxin | 0.8-2 microgram/L |
| Vancomycin | 10-20 mg/L* |
| Tacrolimus | 5-20 microgram/L  |
| Serolimus | 5-15 microgram/L  |
| Phenytoin |10-20 mg/L|
|***Trough**|

##Timing of samples
* Sampling for **toxicity** should occur at times of **peak concentration**  
  This requires accounting for absorption and distribution. Digoxin levels should be performed >6 hours following a dose to allow time for distribution to occur.  
  If symptomatic, sampling occurred at this time may demonstrated toxic concentrations.

* Sampling for **monitoring** should ideally occur at **steady state**, i.e. after 4-5 half-lives. For drugs with long half-lives such as amiodarone, sampling tends to occur earlier to ensure toxic levels have not been reached, as steady state may take months to achieve.

* For drugs with short half-lives, **trough levels** (i.e. pre-dose levels) should be taken as this is the least variable point in the dosing interval. For drugs with long half lives, timing of sampling is less important.

##Interpretation
Interpretation of drug levels is dependent on:
* **Timing** of sample
* Duration of treatment at the current dose and **dosing** schedule
* Individual characteristics that may affect the **pharmacokinetics**
    * Age
    * Physiology
    * Comorbidities (hepatic, renal, cardiac)
    * Drug interactions
    * Genetics
    * Environmental
* **Protein binding**  
  Assays measure bound and unbound drug, whilst only unbound drug is pharmacologically active. If binding is changed by disease or displacement by other drug, the proportion of unbound drug may change and targeted levels may need to be adjusted accordingly.
* **Active metabolites**  
  Active metabolites are not measured but will contribute to the response.
