# Anti-Asthma Drugs {#id}
> Describe the pharmacology of anti-asthma drugs.

* **Oxygen**  
Increases FiO<sub>2</sub> and improves saturation.
* **Heliox**  
Reduces specific gravity of inhaled gas mixtures, improving laminar flow.
* **β<sub>2</sub>-agonists**  
Acts on a G-protein coupled receptor to ↑ cellular levels of adenylyl cyclase, ↑ cAMP, which results in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilatation.
* **Corticosteroids**  
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that bind to specific intracellular receptors and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. They are used in asthma as they cause:
 * Bronchodilatation by increasing bronchial smooth muscle response to circulating catecholamines
 * Decreased airway oedema by decreasing inflammatory responses and transudate production
* **Muscarinic antagonists**  
Anti-muscarinics are synthetic quaternary ammonium compounds which competitively inhibit M3 muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, antagonising the bronchoconstrictor action of vagal impulses.
* **Methylxanthines**  
Methylxanthines are phosphodiesterase inhibitors, reducing levels of cAMP hydrolysis and increased intracellular levels of cAMP (via a different mechanism, so they are synergistic with β<sub>2</sub> agonists) and causing smooth muscle relaxation.
* **Ketamine**  
Increases sympathetic outflow and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. 
* **Volatile Anaesthetic Agents**  
Volatile anaesthetic agents reduces bronchial smooth muscle constriction where this is preexisting (such as asthma).
* **Leukotriene Antagonists**  
Selectively inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, increased activity of which is involved in airway oedema and bronchial smooth muscle constriction.
