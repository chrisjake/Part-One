# Organophosphate Poisoning

Organophosphates are substances bind **irreversibly** to **acetylcholinestersase**, causing cholinergic excess. Examples include fertilisers and sarin gas.


##Toxicity
Effects (as expected) are signs of muscarininc and nicotinic overactivation. This can be remembered by 'BLUDGES' for the muscarinic effects:
* **B**radycardia (and subsequent hypotension)
* **L**acrimation
* **U**rination
* **D**efecation
* **G**IT upset
* **E**mesis
* **S**weating and **S**alivation

and 'M' for the nicotinic effects:
* **M**uscular spasm

##Management
Management is aimed at reducing ACh burden.

**Atropine** is an anticholinergic agent which directly antagonises ACh. It is preferred over glycopyrrolate as it will cross the blood brain barrier and treat central ACh toxicity.

**Pralidoxime** reactivates ACh by luring the organophosphate away from the enzyme with a tantalising oxime group. However, pralidoxime must be used within the first few hours of poisoning (after which the organophosphate-enzyme group 'ages' and is no longer susceptible) to be effective, and does not cross the blood-brain barrier and so cannot treat central effects.
