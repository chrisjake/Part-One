#Diuretics
> An understanding of the pharmacology of diuretics.

Diuretics are drugs that act on the kidney to increase urine production. There are six classes:
* Thiazides
* Loop diuretics
* Potassium sparing
* Aldosterone antagonists
* Osmotic
* Carbonic Anhydrase inhibitors

##Common Features of Diuretics
|Property|Diuretics
|--|--|
|**Absorption**|Typically poor bioavailability (exception: **acetazolamide** is the exception)
|**Distribution**|Variable protein binding
|**Metabolism**|Not metabolised (exception: a small amount of **frusemide** is metabolised to glucuronide)
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of unchanged drug
|**CVS**|Reduced intra and extravascular volume
|**Renal**|Any diuretic which inhibits sodium reabsorption can precipitate hypokalaemia (as a greater intra-luminal concentration of sodium results in exchange of sodium for potassium ions), hyponatraemia (as there is still a net loss of sodium), and alkalosis (from loss of hydrogen ions exchanged for sodium, or the overall raised strong ion difference).

|**Example**|Chlorothiazide|Frusemide|Amiloride|Spironolactone|Mannitol|Acetazolamide|
| **Site**|Distal tubule|Loop of Henle|Distal tubule|Distal tubule|Glomerulus|Proximal tubule|
|**Mechanism of action**|Inhibit Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> reabsorption|Inhibit Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> reabsorption in the thick ascending limb, impeding the counter-current multiplier. This reduces the hypertonicity of the medulla, and subsequent water reabsorption in the collecting system.|Inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> exchange pump. Weak effect.|Competitive aldosterone antagonist. Aldosterone stimulates Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, which in turn stimulates K<sup>+</sup> secretion.|Filtered at the glomerulus and not reabsorbed, increasing filtrate osmolarity and increases water excretion.|Non-competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibition, causing a bicarbonate diuresis. There is a loss of Na<sup>+</sup>, urinary HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and a retention of H<sup>+</sup> |
|**Resp**||||||↑ RR due to metabolic acidosis
|**Cardiac** |Antihypertensive due to reduced plasma volume and SVR|Anteriolar vasodilation, reducing SVR and preload|||Increases intravascular volume, increasing preload. May increase CO or result in cardiac failure.||
|**CNS**|||||↓ ICP|↓ IOP, ↓ ICP|
|**Renal**| Reduced renal blood flow and GFR|Increased renal blood flow and GFR|||Increased renal blood flow|Urinary alkalinisation and diuresis. In the tubule, prevents conversion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> to CO<sub>2</sub>, causing HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> elimination. In the tubular epithelium, prevents conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, which supplies hydrogen ions usually secreted into the proximal tubule in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup>. This causes both a retention of acid and loss of Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O.|
|**Metabolic**|Hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic alkalosis. Hyperglycaemia. |Hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia. Occasional **hyper**uricaemia precipitating gout.|Hyperkalaemia.|Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia.||Hyperchloraemic acidosis|
|**Miscellaneous**|Blood dyscrasias|Deafness, typically following large doses. More common in kidney impairment and with aminoglycoside use.||Gynaecomastia and menstrual irregularity due to anti-androgenism from aldosterone antagonism||||
