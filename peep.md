# Positive Pressure Ventilation
> Describe the physiological consequences of intermittent positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure.

Physiological effects of positive pressure ventilation are mostly related to the **increased mean airway pressure**. This is a function of:
* Ventilation mode
* Tidal volume and peak (and plateau) airway pressure
* Respiratory rate
* I:E ratio
* PEEP  
PEEP has a much larger effect than the other factors.
    * PEEP is defined as a positive airway pressure at the end of expiration
    * PEEP is distinct from positive airway pressure (which is not confined to a phase of the respiratory cycle) and CPAP (which is a mode of ventilation)
    * iPEEP refers to **intrinsic PEEP**, auto PEEP or dynamic hyperinflation  
    iPEEP is PEEP generated by the patient, and occurs when expiration stops before the lung volume reaches FRC.
        * Application of external PEEP may limit the generation of iPEEP by maintaining airway patency in late expiration


###Respiratory Effects
* Decreased work of breathing
    * Decreased VO<sub>2</sub>
* Alteration in anatomical/apparatus dead space  
    * Intubation typically reduces dead space, as the additional apparatus dead space is of smaller volume than the anatomical dead space it replaces
    * Non-invasive ventilation masks cause a large increase in dead space
* Increases lung volume and FRC by an amount proportional to the compliance of the system
    * Improves oxygenation via alveolar recruitment
    * Improves lung compliance via alveolar recruitment, reducing work of breathing
    * Elevated airway pressures may increase the proportion of West Zone 1 physiology and alveolar dead space  
    In healthy lungs an increase in the $$V_D \over V_T$$ ratio is seen when PEEP exceeds 10-15cmH<sub>2</sub>O.
* Reduces airway resistance  
Airway resistance decreases as lung volume increases.

###Cardiovascular Effects
* Alteration in cardiac output
    * PEEP and IPPV generally decrease CO via decreasing VR due to the increase in intrathoracic pressure.    
    Leads to reduction in RV filling pressure, LV filling, and CO.
        * This is the predominant reason why CO falls with the application of PEEP  
        In a well patient, CO falls by:
            * 10% with IPPV and ZEEP
            * 18% with IPPV and 9cmH<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP
            * 36% with IPPV and 16cmH<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP
        * These changes are:
            * More marked in hypovolaemia  
            Changes are reversed with volume expansion.
            * Less severe with poor lung compliance  
            Reduced compliance greatly reduces the effect of PEEP and IPPV on the vasculature, as the rise in intrapleural pressure is reduced.
    * LV preload may also be reduced due to increased RV afterload  
        * Increased RV afterload may increase RV EDV, displacing the interventricular septum into the LV
        * The bulging septum decreases LVEDV, causing LV diastolic function and reduced LV filling  
        This is an example of **ventricular interdependence**.
    * Reduced LV afterload due to reduced LV transmural pressure  
    In some cases, IPPV augments circulatory function by reducing LV afterload to a greater extent than preload. 
        * Effects in a well patient are minimal, as PEEP is relatively small in magnitude compared to systemic arterial pressures
        * In patients generating highly negative intrathoracic pressures, the LV transmural pressure can increase markedly, increasing LV afterload and reducing cardiac output


* Reduction in MAP  
MAP decreases as PEEP increases.


* Changes to oxygen flux  
PEEP will tend to improve PO<sub>2</sub> whilst reducing CO.


* Changes to pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload
    * If lung volume is lower than FRC, then PVR will reduce as PEEP stretches open extra-alveolar vessels
        * Alveolar recruitment will reduce hypoxic-pulmonary vasoconstriction, further reducing PVR
    * If lung volume is higher than FRC, then PVR will increase as PEEP compresses alveolar vessels
    * Therefore, PEEP has *variable effects* on RV afterload depending on how it changes lung volume with respect to FRC



##End-Organ Effects
* Reduced urine output due to:
    * Reduced CO and renal blood flow
    * ADH release as a consequence of reduced atrial stretch and ANP release  
    May worsen oedema in patients with prolonged periods of ventilation.


* Reduced hepatic blood flow due to:
    * Increased CVP and decreased CO lowering the pressure gradient for hepatic flow
        * May result in circulation only intermittently throughout the cardiac cycle
