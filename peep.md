# PEEP
> Describe the physiological consequences of intermittent positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure.

PEEP is defined as a positive airway pressure at the end of expiration. It is distinct from positive airway pressure (which is not confined to a phase of the respiratory cycle) and CPAP (which is a mode of ventilation).

iPEEP refers to **intrinsic PEEP**, auto PEEP or dynamic hyperinflation. In all cases the PEEP is generated by the patient. This occurs in expiration stops before the lung volume reaches FRC. Application of external PEEP may limit the generation of iPEEP by maintaining airway patency in late expiration.

Physiological effects of IPPV are predominantly related to mean airway pressure, and so are generally similar to PEEP.

##Physiological Effects of PEEP

###Respiratory Effects
* Increases lung volume and FRC by an amount proportional to the compliance of the system.
    * Improves oxygenation via alveolar recruitment
    * Improves lung compliance via alveolar recruitment, reducing work of breathing
    * May increase the proportion of West Zone 1 physiology, as when PA exceeds Pa, dead space ventilation occurs

###Cardiovascular Effects
####Cardiac Effects
* Reduction in VR due to RA compression, with consequent reduction RV filling pressure, LV filling, and CO
    * This is the predominant reason why CO falls with the application of PEEP
    * These changes are more marked in hypovolaemia



* However, PEEP also reduces LV afterload by reducing the LV transmural pressure. Effects in a normal patient are minimal, as PEEP is relatively small in magnitude compared to systemic arterial pressures. However, in dyspnoeic patients generating highly negative intrathoracic pressures, the LV transmural pressure can increase markedly, increasing LV afterload and reducing cardiac output.


* Changes to pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload
    * If lung volume is lower than optimal, then PVR will reduce as PEEP stretches open extra-alveolar vessels
        * This may also reduce hypoxic-pulmonary vasoconstriction, further reducing PVR
    * If lung volume is higher than optimal, then PVR will increase as PEEP compresses alveolar vessels
    * Therefore, PEEP has *variable effects* on RV afterload depending on how it changes lung volume


* Ventricular interdependence  
  The ventricles share a common septum and myocardial fibres. Changes in physiology to one ventricle will affect the other - e.g. an increase in RV preload will reduce LV compliance and LVEDV.

####Peripheral Vasculature Effects
* Reduced urine output due to:
    * Reduced CO and renal blood flow
    * ADH release as a consequence of reduced atrial stretch and ANP release


* Reduced hepatic blood flow due to:
    * Increased CVP and decreased CO lowering the pressure gradient for hepatic flow
        * May result in circulation only intermittently throughout the cardiac cycle
