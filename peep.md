# Positive Pressure Ventilation
> Describe the physiological consequences of intermittent positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure.

Physiological effects of positive pressure ventilation are mostly related to the **increased mean airway pressure**. This is a function of:
* Ventilation mode
* Tidal volume and peak (and plateau) airway pressure
* Respiratory rate
* I:E ratio
* PEEP  
PEEP has a much larger effect than the other factors.
    * PEEP is defined as a positive airway pressure at the end of expiration
    * PEEP is distinct from positive airway pressure (which is not confined to a phase of the respiratory cycle) and CPAP (which is a mode of ventilation)
    * iPEEP refers to **intrinsic PEEP**, auto PEEP or dynamic hyperinflation  
    iPEEP is PEEP generated by the patient, and occurs when expiration stops before the lung volume reaches FRC.
        * Application of external PEEP may limit the generation of iPEEP by maintaining airway patency in late expiration


###Respiratory Effects
* Decreased work of breathing
    * Decreased VO<sub>2</sub>
* Alteration in dead space  
    * Intubation typically reduces dead space, as the additional apparatus dead space is of smaller volume than the anatomical dead space it replaces
    * Non-invasive ventilation masks cause a large increase in dead space
* Increases lung volume and FRC by an amount proportional to the compliance of the system
    * Improves oxygenation via alveolar recruitment
    * Improves lung compliance via alveolar recruitment, reducing work of breathing
    * Elevated airway pressures may increase the proportion of West Zone 1 physiology and alveolar dead space  
    In healthy lungs an increase in the $$V_D \over V_T$$ ratio is seen when PEEP exceeds 10-15cmH<sub>2</sub>O

###Cardiovascular Effects
####Cardiac Effects
* Reduction in VR due to increased CVP  
Leads to reduction in RV filling pressure, LV filling, and CO.
    * This is the predominant reason why CO falls with the application of PEEP
    * These changes are more marked in hypovolaemia


* Changes to pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload
    * If lung volume is lower than FRC, then PVR will reduce as PEEP stretches open extra-alveolar vessels
        * Alveolar recruitment will reduce hypoxic-pulmonary vasoconstriction, further reducing PVR
    * If lung volume is higher than FRC, then PVR will increase as PEEP compresses alveolar vessels
    * Therefore, PEEP has *variable effects* on RV afterload depending on how it changes lung volume with respect to FRC


* Reduced LV preload due to increased RV afterload  
Increased RV afterload may lead to an increased RV EDV, displacing the interventricular septum into the LV, impeding LV diastolic function and reducing LV filling. This is an example of **ventricular interdependence**.


* Reduced LV afterload due to reduced LV transmural pressure  
    * Effects in a well patient are minimal, as PEEP is relatively small in magnitude compared to systemic arterial pressures
    * In patients generating highly negative intrathoracic pressures, the LV transmural pressure can increase markedly, increasing LV afterload and reducing cardiac output

####Peripheral Vasculature Effects
* Reduced urine output due to:
    * Reduced CO and renal blood flow
    * ADH release as a consequence of reduced atrial stretch and ANP release  
    May worsen oedema in patients with prolonged periods of ventilation.


* Reduced hepatic blood flow due to:
    * Increased CVP and decreased CO lowering the pressure gradient for hepatic flow
        * May result in circulation only intermittently throughout the cardiac cycle
