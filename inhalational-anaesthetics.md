##Common Features of Inhalational Agents

|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic CYP450 (CYP2E1) metabolises C-halogen bonds to release halogen ions (F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>), which can be nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic. The C-F bond is minimally metabolised compared to the C-Cl, C-Br, and C-I bonds.
|**Resp**|All halogenated agents ↓ V<sub>T</sub> and ↑ RR, with an overall ↓ in MV and therefore cause PaCO<sub>2</sub> to ↑; and ↓ sensitivity of central respiratory centres to CO<sub>2</sub>.
|**CVS**|↓ MAP (predominantly by ↓ in SVR), ↓ inotropy
|**CNS**|↓ EEG frequency such that θ- and δ-wave dominate the EEG as depth ↑. May cause burst suppression. ↓ CMRO<sub>2</sub> and CBF. Cause cerebral vasodilation but **do not increase ICP** when MAC is < 1.
|**Renal**|Dose dependent ↓ in RBF, GFR, and UO secondary to ↓ in MAP and CO. <br><br>Fluorinated ethers produce F<sup>-</sup> ions when hepatically metabolised, which may produce high-output renal failure at serum concentrations >50μmol/L. This is probably only a concern with methoxyflurane (as it has significant (>70%) hepatic metabolism) when used at anaesthetic doses.
|**GIT**|↓ Hepatic blood flow. 
|**GU**|Tocolysis
|**Immune**|
|**Metabolic**|
|**Toxic Effects**|

##Comparison of Common Inhalational Agents
|Property|Sevoflurane|Isoflurane|Desflurane|
|--|--|
|**Pharmaceutics**|Minimally soluble, light stable, not flammable. Formulated with 300ppm of H<sub>2</sub>O to prevent formation of HF acid by Lewis acids in glass|Soluble in rubber, light stable, not flammable|Light sensitive, flammable at 17%|
|**Molecular Weight**|200.1|184.5|168.0
|**Boiling point**|58.5°C|48.5°C|23.5°C|
|**SVP** at 20°C|
|**Blood:gas coefficient**|0.7|1.4|0.42|
|**Oil:gas coefficient**|80|98|29|
|**MAC**|1.8|1.17|6.6|
|**Metabolism**|3-5% CYP2E1 metabolism to hexafluoroisopropanol and inorganic F<sup>-</sup> (which may be nephrotoxic)|0.2% hepatic to nontoxic metabolites
|**Resp**|Bronchodilation, ↓ MV|Bronchodilation, airway irritability. ↓ MV (greater than halothane) with ↑ in RR|Airway irritability, ↑ secretions|
|**CVS**|↑ QT, ↓ SVR causing ↓ MAP without a reflex ↑ HR. Inotropy unchanged.|Reflex ↑ HR due to ↓ MAP from ↓ SVR. Small ↓ inotropy and CO. May cause **coronary steal**.
|**CNS**|↑ post-operative agitation in children compared to halothane|Best balance of ↓ CMRO<sub>2</sub> for ↑ in CBF ||
|**GIT**||||
|**Immune**|
|**Metabolic**|
|**Toxic Effects**|Sevoflurane interacts with soda lime to produce **Compound A** (as well as B through E, which are unimportant), which is nephrotoxic in rats (but not, it seems, in humans).|-CHF<sub>2</sub> group may react with dry soda lime to produce CO||

##Comparison of Uncommon Inhalational Agents

|**Pharmaceutics**||Light unstable. Corrodes some metals and dissolves into rubber.||Not flammable.
|**Molecular Weight**|184.5|197||131|

|**MAC**|1.68|0.75||71
|**Metabolism**||~25% undergoes oxidative phosphorylation by CYP450 systems, producing **trifluoroacetic acid**, which binds to protein and can cause a T-cell mediated hepatitis, which can be fatal in ~1/10,000 anaesthetics.
|**Resp**|
|**CVS**||Greatest ↓ in inotropy, HR, SVR, and MAP.
|**CNS**||||Analgesic|
|**MSK**||||Muscle relaxation when >60%
|**Renal**|Direct nephrotoxicity, potentially related to fluoride (though this association is not present with other anaesthetic agents)
