# Pain
> Describe the physiology of pain, including the pathways and mediators

Pain is an "unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage."

Pain can be broadly classified by aetiology and chronicity:
* **Nociceptive pain**  
  Stimulation of nociceptors by noxious stimuli.
* **Visceral pain**  
* **Neuropathic pain**  
  Nervous system dysfunction.
* **Chronic pain**  
  Pain that is no longer due to the initial insult.

##Peripheral Nociception
Nociceptors can be **stimulated** or **sensitised** by chemical, mechanical, or thermal signals. Stimulation initiates a nervous impulse, whilst sensitisation increases a receptors sensitivity to a stimulating mediator. Some key mediators include:

|Stimulating Mediators|Sensitising Mediators|
|--|--|
|H<sup>+</sup>|Prostaglandins
|K<sup>+</sup>|Leukotrienes
|ACh|Substance P
|Histamine|Neurokinin A
|5-HT|Calcitonin GRP
|Bradykinin|||

Impulses are conducted by two types of **primary afferent fibres**:
* Aδ fibres are **2-5μm** diameter **myelinated** fibres that conduct sharp pain at 40m.s<sup>-1</sup>. They mediate initial reflex responses to acute pain.
* C fibres are **<2μm** diameter **unmyelinated** fibres that conduct dull pain at 2m.s<sup>-1</sup>

###Gate Theory
Aβ 'touch' fibres stimulate inhibitory interneurones in the dorsal horn, which cause **descending inhibition** and prevent signals from peripheral C fibres from rising ascending to the thalamus. Stimulation of touch neurons 'closes the gate' and reduces pain sensation.


##Response to a Painful Stimulus
The response to a painful stimulus requires a cascade of processes:
* **Activation of nociceptors**  
  Respond to either mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimulation, causing membrane depolarisation. If the stimulus is great enough to reach the threshold potential, an action potential is generated.
    * Upregulation of receptor sensitivity is associated with neuropathic pain


* **Synapse in the dorsal horn**  
  Aδ and C fibres synapse with an **interneuron** in the dorsal horn. In addition to innervation from peripheral fibres, the interneuron receives input from **descending fibres** from the brain which can increase or decrease its sensitivity. This is one mechanism for descending inhibition (or sensitisation).

    This interneuron then synapses with a **secondary afferent** fibre, which crosses within 1-2 vertebral segments and ascends in the spinothalamic tract. The secondary afferent **also receives input from descending fibres**.
  
    
* **Reflex arc**  

* **Higher centres**  
    Pain perception occurs in the somatosensory cortex.

##Neuropathic Pain
Pain caused by a lesion of the somatosensory system, rather than a stimulus itself. A variety of different mechanisms exist:
* Central neuropathic pain  
From CNS injury, e.g. spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis.
* Peripheral neuropathic pain  
Damage from:
    * Diabetes  
    Ischaemia of Schwann cells causes demyelination, causing the exposed axon to generate action potentials inappropriately.
    * Trauma  
    Transected axons may regrow with endings that spontaneously fire or that have altered threshold potentials.

###Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome
Damage to the SNS can lead to abnormalities in autonomic function:
* Change in temperature due to vasomotor dysfunction
* Altered sweating
* Reduced hair growth
* Osteoporosis
* Hyperalgesia and allodynia
