# Pain
> Describe the physiology of pain, including the pathways and mediators




Key definitions:
* **Pain**  
Pain is an "unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage." Pain can be broadly classified by:
  * Aetiology
    * **Nociceptive pain**  
      Stimulation of nociceptors by noxious stimuli.
    * **Visceral pain**  
    * **Neuropathic pain**  
    Nervous system dysfunction.
  * Duration
    * Acute pain  
    Pain due to symptoms of current pathology.
    * **Chronic pain**  
    Pain occurring after the pathological process has resolved.
    
    
* **Hyperalgesia**  
Increased response to a normally painful stimulus.
  * Primary hyperalgesia  
  Local reduction in pain threshold.
  * Secondary hyperalgesia  
  Hyperalgesia away from the site of injury due to alteration in spinal cord signaling.
  
  
* **Allodynia**  
Painful response to a normally painless stimuli. Occurs due to pathological synapse between second-order neurones in the spinal cord.

* **Anaesthesia dolorosa**  
Pain in an area which is anaesthetised.


##Peripheral Nociception
Nociceptors are receptors which respond to a noxious stimulus. Nociceptors:
* Can be **stimulated** or **sensitised** by:
  * Chemical signals  
  See table.
  * Mechanical signals
    * Shear stress
  * Thermal signals
    * Hot nociceptors activate above 43°C
    * Cold nociceptors activate below 26°C
* Stimulation initiates a nervous impulse
* Sensitisation increases a receptors sensitivity to a stimulating mediator  


Key chemical stimulating and sensitising mediators include:

|Stimulating Mediators|Sensitising Mediators|
|--|--|
|H<sup>+</sup>|Prostaglandins
|K<sup>+</sup>|Leukotrienes
|ACh|Substance P
|Histamine|Neurokinin A
|5-HT|Calcitonin GRP
|Bradykinin|||

###Nociceptors
Impulses are conducted by two types of **primary afferent fibres**:
* Aδ fibres:
  * Small (~**2-5μm** diameter)
  * **Myelinated**
  * Conduct sharp pain at up to 40m.s<sup>-1</sup>  
  * Mediate initial reflex responses to acute pain
  * Synapse in laminae I in the DRG  
  Substance P is the neurotransmitter at the NK1 receptor.
* C fibres:
  * **<2μm** diameter
  * **Unmyelinated**
  * Conduct dull pain at 2m.s<sup>-1</sup>
  * Synapse in laminae II in the DRG  
  Substance P is the neurotransmitter at the NK1 receptor.


##Pain Pathway and Site of Action of Analgesics
The response to a painful stimulus requires a cascade of processes:
* **Activation of nociceptors**  
  Membrane depolarisation in response to stimulus. If the stimulus is great enough to reach the threshold potential, an action potential is generated.
    * **NSAIDS** reduce nociceptor mediated inflammation
    * **Opiates** act on peripheral MOP receptors
    * **Local anaesthetics** prevent signal propagation
* **Synapse in the dorsal horn**  
  Input from both Aδ and C fibres, and descending interneurons.
    * Descending inhibitory input reduces nociceptive transmission  
    Basis of "gate control" theory. Descending input increased with:
      * Touch  
      Aβ 'touch' fibres stimulate inhibitory interneurones in the dorsal horn, 'closing the gate' by increasing **descending inhibition** and prevent signals from peripheral C fibres from rising ascending to the thalamus.
      * Arousal
      * Opioid receptors  
      Particularly MOP (pre- and post-synaptically).
        * **Opioids** act presynaptically to reduce Substance P and glutamine release.
      * α<sub>2</sub> receptors  
      **Clonidine**, **tricyclic antidepressants**, **noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors**, and endogenous catecholamines.
      * **Gabapentin and pregabalin** inhibit presynaptic neurotransmitter release
    * **Wide dynamic range** neurones  
    Receive afferent input from chemical, thermal, and mechanoreceptors.  
      * Typically more difficult to stimulate
      * Important in **wind-up**  
      Mediated by NMDA agonism.
        * **Ketamine** reduces windup and central sensitisation
      * Lead to secondary hyperalgesia
      * Lead to allodynia  
      Via additional synpases to sensory neurones in lamina III and IV.
  * Interneuron synapses with a **second-order neurones** fibre  
  These secondary afferents:
    * Cross within 1-2 vertebral segments and ascends in the spinothalamic tract
    * Receives input from descending fibres
    * Opioids act post-synaptically to hyperpolarise second-order neurones

  
    
* **Reflex arc**  

* **Higher centres**  
    Pain perception occurs in the somatosensory cortex.

##Neuropathic Pain
Pain due to a lesion of the somatosensory system, rather than a stimulus itself. Neuropathic pain is divided into:
* Central neuropathic pain  
From CNS injury, e.g. spinal cord injury, CVA, multiple sclerosis.
* Peripheral neuropathic pain  
Damage from:
    * Diabetes  
    Ischaemia of Schwann cells causes demyelination, causing the exposed axon to generate action potentials inappropriately.
    * Trauma  
    Transected axons may regrow with endings that spontaneously fire or that have altered threshold potentials.

###Mechanisms of Neuropathic Pain
* Neuroma  
Healing of damaged nerves leads to neuroma formation. Neuromas:
  * Are more sensitive to painful stimuli
  * Cause spontaneous pain
  * May sprout and innervate local tissues  
  Movement of these tissues may lead to pain.
* Windup
* Phantom limb pain  
Neurons damaged in removal of a limb develop additional synapses, leading to phantom sensations.
      



###Features of Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain is associated with:
* Injury or disease that causes nerve injury
* Burning or electrical quality
* Reduced or absent sensation
* Poor response to typical analgesia

###Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome
Damage to the SNS can lead to abnormalities in autonomic function:
* Change in temperature due to vasomotor dysfunction
* Altered sweating
* Reduced hair growth
* Osteoporosis
* Hyperalgesia and allodynia

##Pain in the Elderly
Nervous System Changes:
* **Peripheral Nervous System**  
  * Nerve deterioration
  * Decreased myelination
  * Decreased conduction velocity
  * Reduced range and speed of ANS responses
  * Increased resting sympathetic tone
* **Central Nervous System**  
  * Increased sensitivity to anaesthetic and analgesics
  * Degeneration of myelin  
  Subsequent cognitive dysfunction due to neuronal circuit dysfunction.
  * Generalised atropy
  * Decreased neurotransmitter production
