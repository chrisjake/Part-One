# Cardiac Reflexes
> Describe the cardiac reflexes

Cardiac reflexes are fast-acting reflex loops between the CVS and CNS which contribute to the maintenance of cardiovascular haemostasis.

They include:
* Baroreceptor reflex  
  Aortic arch and carotid body reflexes
* Bainbridge reflex
  Atrial stretch receptor reflexes
* Chemoreceptor reflex
  Decreased PaO<sub>2</sub> < 50mmHg or increased pH sensed by peripheral chemoreceptors causes subsequent tachycardia and hypertension
* Cushing reflex  
  Brainstem compression causes ischaemia of the vasomotor centre leading to Cushings' Triad:
    * Hypertension  
    May have a wide pulse pressure.
    * Bradycardia  
    Due to baroreceptor response from hypertension.
    * Irregular respirations
* Bezold-Jarisch reflex
* Oculocardic reflex

##Bezold-Jarisch Reflex
Stimulation of C fibres of the vagus nerve in the cardiopulmonary region causes significant bradycardia, hypotension, and apnoea followed by rapid shallow breathing.

These fibres can be stimulated by a number of substances, including capsaicin and seratonin. It may also be activated in myocardial ischaemia.

##Oculocardic Reflex
Pressure on the globe or traction on ocular muscles causes a decrease in heart rate. This is mediated by the trigeminal nerve (afferent limb) and the vagus (efferent limb), which results in decreased SA nodal activity.
