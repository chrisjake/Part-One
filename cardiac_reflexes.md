# Cardiac Reflexes
> Describe the cardiac reflexes

Cardiac reflexes are fast-acting reflex loops between the CVS and CNS which contribute to the maintenance of cardiovascular haemostasis.

They include:
* **Baroreceptor reflex**  
  Aortic arch and carotid body reflexes.
  
  
* **Bainbridge reflex**  
  Atrial stretch receptor reflexes.
  
  
* **Chemoreceptor reflex**  
  Decreased PaO<sub>2</sub> < 50mmHg or increased pH sensed by peripheral chemoreceptors causes subsequent tachycardia and hypertension.
  
  
* **Cushing reflex**  
  Brainstem compression causes ischaemia of the vasomotor centre leading to Cushings' Triad:
    * Hypertension  
    May have a wide pulse pressure.
    * Bradycardia  
    Due to baroreceptor response from hypertension.
    * Irregular respirations
    
    
* **Bezold-Jarisch reflex**  
  Stimulation of C fibres of the vagus nerve in the cardiopulmonary region.
    * This causescausing:
      * Significant bradycardia
      * Hypotension
      * Apnoea, followed by rapid shallow breathing.
  These fibres can be stimulated by a number of substances, including:
    * Capsaicin
    * Serotonin
    * Those produced in myocardial ischaemia

* **Oculocardic reflex**  
Pressure on the globe or traction on ocular muscles causes a decrease in heart rate. This is mediated by the:
  * Trigeminal nerve (afferent limb)
  * Vagus nerve (efferent limb)  
  Increased vagal tone reduces SA nodal activity.
