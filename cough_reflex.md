# Cough Reflex
> Explain the pathways and importance of the cough reflex

Coughing is an airway protective reflex. It involves a deep inspiration followed by **forced expiration against a closed glottis**.The sudden opening of the cords causes a violent rush of air at **>900km.h<sup>-1</sup>**, removing irritants and secretions from the airways.

##Sensation
Vagus afferents have exquisitely sensitive light touch and corrosive chemical receptors in the larynx, carina, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli.

##Integration
Vagal afferents synapse in the medulla, triggering an autonomic sequence of events.

##Effector
A series of processes occur in three phases:
* Inspiration (close to vital capacity)
* Effort closure of the epiglottis
* Contraction of abdominal musculature and internal intercostals, causing a rapid rise in intrapleural pressure to >100mmHg.
* Wide-opening of the cords and epiglottis, causing a violent expiration
    * Compression of the lungs causes narrowing of the noncartilagenous airways, assisting exploding air pick up unwanted matter in the tracheobronchial tree
