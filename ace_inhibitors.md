# ACE Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs, in turn reducing effects of angiotensin II. Thes effects include:
* Vasoconstriction
* Noradrenaline reuptake inhibition
* Thirst
* ADH release
* ACTH release
* Aldosterone release
* Reduces Kf, reducing GFR

##Indications 
 * **Hypertension**  
  * Particularly in insulin dependent diabetes with diabetic nephropathy
  * Less effective for this indication in the black population
  * Contribute to post-operative hypertension and may be witheld perioperatively
 
 
 * **Cardiac failure**  
All grades.

* **MI with LV dysfunction**  
  Improved prognosis.

##Classification
Can be divided into three groups based on pharmacokinetics:
* Active drug with active metabolites  
Captopril
* Prodrug  
Ramipril
* Not metabolised and excreted unchanged in urine  
Lisinopril

##Common Features of ACE Inhibitors
|Property|Drug
|--|--|
|**Resp**|Bradykinin cough
|**CVS**|↓ SVR and BP. Unaffected HR and baroreceptor response.
|**Endocrine**|Hypoglycaemia in diabetics
|**Renal**|With a normal renal perfusion pressure, natriuresis results. However, a fall in renal perfusion pressure may cause pre-renal failure (e.g. renal artery stenosis).
|**Haeme**|Agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia
|**Immune**|Angioedema
|**Metabolic**| ↑ in renin release.
|**Interactions**|↓ Aldosterone release, which ↑ the efficacy of spironolactone and may precipitate hyperkalaemia. Pharmacodynamic interaction with NSAIDs to drop renal perfusion pressure.
