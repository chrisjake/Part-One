# Carbohydrate Metabolism
> Describe the physiology and biochemistry of ~~fat,~~ carbohydrate ~~and protein~~ metabolism

##Storage
Carbohydrates are stored in liver and muscle as glucose polymers known as **glycogen**.

* The liver contains ~100g of glycogen  
This can maintain plasma glucose for ~24 hours.
* Skeletal muscle cotains ~200g of glycogen  
This cannot be released into circulation, and is for use only by the muscle.

Production of glycogen is stimulated by insulin, which is released as plasma glucose levels rise following carbohydrate ingestion. When plasma glucose levels fall, the release of glucagon and adrenaline stimulates glycogenolysis.

##Metabolism

###Gluconeogenesis
Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from other molecules. It:
* Is a separate pathway
* Requires ATP to perform  
Some organs (heart, brain) rely on glucose for ATP
* Has many potential substrates:
    * Lactate
    * Pyruvate
    * Glycerol
    * Amino acids
    * CAC-intermediates
* Is stimulated by glucagon
* Is inhibited by biguanides (metformin)
