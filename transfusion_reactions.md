>Understanding the adverse consequences of blood transfusion, including that of  massive blood transfusion

##Production and Storage of Blood Products
Red cells, platelets, and FFP have different storage requirements.

###Red Blood Cells
* Stored blood decays over time - this is known as a **storage lesion**  
Preservatives are used to extend the time blood can be stored:
    *  Kept at ~4°C (balance between freezing and being too warm)
        * Reduces cellular metabolic requirement
        * Inhibits bacterial growth
    * Collected in an aseptic fashion
    * Stored in special solutions:
      * SAGM is currently used by the Australian Red Cross:
          * Saline
          * Adenine  
          Substrate for ATP synthesis
          * Glucose  
          Substrate for RBC glycolysis
          * Mannitol
      * CPDA1 (citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine) was traditionally used
          * Citrate binds calcium, preventing clottting
          * Phosphate acts as a buffer and phosphate source for metabolism
          * Dextrose 
          * Adenine 


* A **storage lesion** describes the changes that occur in stored blood:
    * Loss of 2,3 DPG  
    Less of a factor in CPDA1 blood.
    * Haemolysis
    * Hyperkalaemia  
    Typically not clinically relevant as potassium is taken up into red cells when metabolism resumes.
    * Acidaemia
    * Hyponatraemia  
    Not clinically significant.


* Blood can be stored for up to 35 days, which corresponds to 70% survival

###Platelets
Platelets require particular storage conditions to remain functional:
* Temperature ~22°C  
Below this, platelets deform and become non-functional
* Gas exchange
Platelets are stored in a bag which allows gas exchange to occur, minimising lactic acid and carbon dioxide production
* Agitation  
Platelets are stored on an agitator which prevents clotting and ensures the platelets are well mixed, maximising the diffusion gradient for gas exchange
* pH control  
pH is kept between 6.2 to 7.8 to prevent degranulation.

##Blood Groups
Blood groups refer to the expression of surface antigens by red blood cells, as well as any antibody in plasma. Blood groups can be divided into three types:
* ABO
* Rhesus
* Other antibodies
These are additional antibodies that a patient may express in plasma, and include Kell, Lewis, Duffy, etc.

###ABO
The ABO system refers to carbohydrate-based antigens, which may be either A or B. Patients may express one, both, or neither, giving four blood groups (A, B, AB, O).
is the most important for blood transfusion as:
* Individuals express antibody to foreign blood groups
    This develops within 6 months of birth, likely due to environmental exposure to similar antigens.
* An ABO-mismatch hypersensitivity reaction is severe

###Rhesus
There are fifty different Rhesus antigens, the most important of which is **D**. Rhesus status is therefore expressed as positive (D - 85% of the population) or negative (anything-but-D).

Notably, Rhesus negative individuals do not naturally develop antibodies unless exposed:
* Incompatible transfusion
* Foetal-materal haemorrhage  
If blood from an RhD positive foetus is exposed to an RhD negative mother (miscarriage, birth, placetal abruption), the maternal immune system will develop anti-RhD antibodies which (as they are IgG) can cross the placenta and haemolyse the foetus.

##Compatibility Testing
Donor blood must be tested with recipient blood to avoid a transfusion reaction. This involves three processes:
* Blood Typing (ABO/Rh)  
Blood is typed by mixing it with plasma (and plasma with erythrocytes) of known groups.
* Antibody Screen  
For other antibodies.
* Cross-match  
  Involves two processes:
    * Saline test
    * Indirect Coomb's test
    Identifies IgG antibody which would cause haemolysis of transfused red cells. This is typically no longer done, as it offers almost negligible extra safety over the above processes. Doing it however, involves:
        * Incubating, to bind IgG Ab to antigen on RBC membrane
        * Washing, to remove serum and unbound IgG
        * Testing with an antibody *to* IgG, known as antiglobulin serum.
            * A positive test will cause clumping of red cells, as each antiglobulin serum will bind two IgG molecules, which have in turn been bound to red cells.
            * A negative test will cause no agglutination, as the IgG has not been bound to red cells.
                * If negative, the antiglobulin serum is re-used on a control sample to ensure that it is not a false negative.



##Transfusion Reactions
Transfusion reactions can be classified as either acute (< 24 hours) or delayed (> 24 hours), and as immunological or non-immunological.

###Immunological Acute Reactions

|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|ABO Mismatch|1:40000|ABO incompatibility causing rapid intravascular haemolysis, which may cause chest pain, jaundice, shock, and DIC. RhD-reactions tend to cause extravascular haemolysis.
|Haemolytic (acute)|1:76,000 (1:1.8 million fatal)|Immunological destruction of transfused cells (Type II hypersensitivity). Presents with fever, tachycardia, pain, progressing to distributive shock|
|Febrile, non-haemolytic|~1:100|Cytokine release from stored cells causing a mild inflammatory reaction, with temperature rising to ≥38ºC or ≥1ºC above baseline (if >37ºC). Benign - but requires exclusion of a haemolytic reaction.
|Urticaria|1:100|Hypersensitivity to plasma proteins in the transfused unit
|Anaphylaxis|1:20,000|Type I hypersensitivity reaction to plasma protein in transfused uni
|TRALI|Variable|Donor plasma HLA activate recipient leukocyte antigen activating pulmonary neutrophils, causing fever, shock, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema

###Non-Immunological Acute Reactions
|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Massive Transfusion Complications|Variable|See below
|Non-immune mediated haemolysis|Rare|Due to physicochemical damage to RBCs (freezing, device malfunction). May lead to haemoglobinuria, haemoglobinaemia, tachycardia and fevers.
|Sepsis|1:75,000 (platelets), 1:500,000 (RBC)|Contamination during collection or processing
|Transfusion Related Circulatory Overload (TACO)|< 1:100|Rapid increase in intracellular volume in patients with poor circulatory compliance or chronic anaemia. May result in pulmonary oedema and be confused with TRALI.

###Delayed Immunological Reaction
|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction|1:2,500|Development of sensitisation with the reaction occurring 2-14 days after a single exposure. Typically Kidd, Duffy, Kell antibodies.
|Post-tranfusion Purpura|Rare|Alloimmunisation to Human Platelet Antigen causing sudden self-limiting thrombocytopenia
|TA-GVHD|Rare|Transfused lymphocytes recognise host HLA as positive causing marrow aplasia, with mortality >90%
|Alloimmunisation| 1:100 (RBC antigens), 1:10 (HLA antigens)|Previous sensitisation leading to  antibody production on re-exposure.
|Transfusion-related Immune Modulation|Not known|Transient immunosuprression following transfusion potentially due to cytokine release from leukocytes

###Delayed Non-Immunological Reaction
|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Iron Overload|Chelation after 10-20 units, organ dysfunction 50-100 units|Each unit of PRBC contains ~250mg of iron, whilst average excretion is 1mg.day<sup>-1</sup>.


##Complications of Massive Transfusion
A **massive transfusion** is one where:
* Greater than **one-half** of **circulating volume** in **4 hours**
* Whole **circulating volume** in **24 hours**


Risk of complication from a massive transfusion is influenced by:
* Number of units
* Rate of transfusion
* Patient factors

|Complication|Mechanism|
|------|-----------|
|Air embolism|Inadvertant infusion
|Hypothermia|Cooled products
|Hypocalcaemia|Consumption with coagulopathy and bound to citrate added to transfused units
|Hypomagnesaemia|Bound to citrate in transfused units
|Citrate toxicity|Citrate is added to stored units as an anticoagulant
|Lactic acidosis|Hyperlactataemia due to anaerobic metabolism in stored units
|Hyperkalaemia|Potassium migratrates from stored erythrocytes into plasma whilst in storage
