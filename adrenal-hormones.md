#Adrenal Hormones
> Describe the control, secretions and functions of ~~renal and~~ adrenal hormones

The adrenal glands are paired triangular glands at the superior pole of the kidney. The gland can be divided into:
* Adrenal cortex  
Consists of three layers which produce **steroid hormones** (A good mnemonic is GFR for the layers, and ACT(H) for hormones)
    * Zona Glomerulosa  
    Predominantly produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).
    * Zona Fasciculata  
    Predominantly produces glucocorticoids (cortisone).
    * Zona Reticularis  
    Predominantly produces sex steroids (testosterone).
* Adrenal medulla  
Produces catecholamines.

##Steroid Hormones
###Mineralocorticoids
Aldosterone is the key mineralocorticoid hormone, accounting for 95% of mineralocorticoid activity:
* Release is stimulated by:
    * Increased serum K<sup>+</sup>
    * Increased Angiotensin II
        * Hypovolaemia
        * Decreased osmolarity
    * Increased ACTH
    * Decreased serum pH
* Acts to increase sodium and water retention (and removal of potassium), via:
    * Increased expression and activation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps on the basolateral membrane of DCT and CT cells, causing increased Na<sup>+</sup> (and water) reabsorption and K<sup>+</sup> elimination
    * Stimulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pump in intercalated cells on the DCT

###Glucocorticoids
Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the primary glucocorticoid in the body, accounting for 95% of endogenous glucocorticoid effect. Cortisol is:
* Produced at ~15-30mg.day<sup>-1</sup>
* Released in response to ACTH  
ACTH is released in response to CRH, which is:
    * Released in response to stress
    * Modulated by circadian rhythms, and demonstrates diurnal variation:
        * CRH peaks just before waking
        * CRH troughs during sleep

Cortisol has effects on many organ systems, and in **physiological** amounts cause:
* CVS
    * Increased sensitivity to catecholamines
    * Increases fluid retention
* Metabolic  
(Essentially anti-insulin effects):
    * Gluconeogenesis  
    To provide substrates, it also stimulates:
        * Proteolysis
        * Lipolysis
    * Decreased glucose uptake

##Catecholamines
Naturally occurring catecholamines include:
* Adrenaline
* Noradrenaline
* Dopamine

Synthesis of catecholamines occurs in the **adrenal medulla**, which is a **modified sympathetic ganglion** composed of **chromaffin cells**.
* Synthesis and release is dependent on **ACh release** by the presynaptic neuron  
Unlike many other hormones, catecholamine secretion is not a negative-feedback loop.

Process of catecholamine synthesis:
* **Tyrosine** is concentrated in the adrenal medulla
* Tyrosine is hydroxylated to DOPA by **tyrosine hydroxylase**  
This is the **rate-limiting** step, and is probably the best enzyme to remember.
* DOPA is decarboxylated to dopamine
* Dopamine is converted to noradrenaline
* Noradrenaline is converted to adrenaline by **PNMT** (Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase)  
This may only occur in the adrenal medulla.

Plasma half-lives of noradrenaline and adrenaline are small as a consequence of their metabolism and elimination.

* Extraneuronal uptake in the lungs, liver, kidney, and GIT
* Neuronal uptakeby sympathetic nerve endings
* Inactivation by MAO in nerve cytoplasm
* Inactivation by COMT in the liver and kidney

###Structure-Activity Relationships of Catecholamines
Catecholamines consist of:
* A catechol ring  
A benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups in the 3 and 4 position.  
    * Losing a hydroxyl group increases lipid solubility and decreases the potency 10-fold   
        * Losing both decreases the potency 100-fold
    * Losing a hydroxyl group prevents metabolism by COMT, prolonging duration of action
    * Changing the hydroxyl groups to the 3 and 5 position increases beta-2 selectivity when there is also a large substitution present on the amine group.
* An ethylamine tail  
Consists of:
    * Beta carbon  
        * Adding a hydroxyl group decreases lipid solubility and CNS penetration
        * Adding any group increases alpha and beta effects
    * Alpha carbon  
        * Adding a group prevents metabolism by MAO, prolonging duration of action
        * Methylation increases indirect activity
    * Amine group
        * Addition of a methyl group generally increases beta selectivity  
        As the chain length increases, so does the beta selectivity.
