#Adrenal Hormones
> Describe the control, secretions and functions of ~~renal and~~ adrenal hormones

The adrenal glands are paired triangular glands at the superior pole of the kidney. The gland can be divided into:
* Adrenal cortex  
Consists of three layers which produce **steroid hormones** (A good mnemonic is GFR for the layers, and ACT(H) for hormones)
    * Zona Glomerulosa  
    Predominantly produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).
    * Zona Fasciculata  
    Predominantly produces glucocorticoids (cortisone).
    * Zona Reticularis  
    Predominantly produces sex steroids (testosterone).
* Adrenal medulla  
Produces catecholamines.

##Steroid Hormones
###Mineralocorticoids
Aldosterone is the key mineralocorticoid hormone:
* Release is stimulated by:
    * Increased serum K<sup>+</sup>
    * Increased Angiotensin II
    * Decreased ECF osmolality
    * Decreased intravascular volume
* Acts to increase sodium and water retention (and removal of potassium), via:
    * Increased expression and activation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps on the basolateral membrane of DCT and CT cells, causing increased Na<sup>+</sup> (and water) reabsorption and K<sup>+</sup> elimination
    * Stimulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pump in intercalated cells on the DCT

###Glucocorticoids
Cortisol
