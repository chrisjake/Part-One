#How to Pass

The first part exam is:
* Painful  
The knowledge requires is huge, and cannot be avoided.
* Eminently achievable  
Remember, it is not impossible - **everybody before you has completed it**.

##Plan for Success
This is not an exam you want to have to sit more than once - try to give yourself the best chance of success the first time round.

Commit yourself early:
* Decide when you are going to sit
    * Pick a date ~9 months in advance
        * 6 months is pushing it
        * 9 months is achievable
        * 12 months is almost too long - you will lose motivation and knowledge.
    * Accept that the time between now and the exam is not going to be the best time of your life
    * Consider paying the money as soon as possible - lock yourself in
    * Your family and friends will forgive you, eventually

Don't lose faith:
* There will be times that you question why you have to learn this
    * Accept that much of this exam is an academic hazing ritual (rather than learning clinically applicable knowledge) you must pass through on your path to fellowship

##Be Strategic
The curriculum provided is overwhelming, and probably not achievable for most of us. Have a plan about how you will approach it:
* Have a timetable
    * Content to cover each week  
    I found that setting myself a weekly goal would allow me to plan around day-to-day variations (finishing late, good days, bad days, etc), whilst the daily timetable was often mangled by life, creating unnecessary stress.
    * Time to start viva practice  
    Before the written.

* Know the enemy
    * Syllabus  
    Read through it so you appreciate the breadth of knowledge required.
    * Style of exam questions  
    Including the style of answers - see [the SAQ](./the-saq.md).
    * Graphs
    * Style of vivas  
        * Do practice vivas  
            * Record yourself, so you know your tics.
            * Do a dress rehearsal  
            Make sure your suit still fits before the day.

* **Do past questions**  
I cannot stress this enough.
    * Past questions:
        * Teach you appropriate structure
        * Teach you to write to time
        * Ensure you learn the content in the way it will be recalled
        * Ensure you don't waste time learning things that will not be examined
        When I sat the CICM exam, I had done almost all the past questions, which covered ~60% of the curriculum. There was 1 (out of 24) of the SAQs on a topic I had not answered an SAQ on before.

* **Remember the pass mark is 50%%**  
Breadth over depth.

###What I did
* Read Power & Kam to get an overview of the topic  
I would now avoid Power & Kam (it has a lot of errors), and instead read Basic Physiology for the Anaesthetist, by Chambers, Huang, and Matthews. Or this site.
* Started doing practice questions:  
I did practice questions (and note making) on my days off.
    * I started doing one question at a time  
    In the beginning, I didn't know enough to write for 10 minutes.
        * After doing the question, I would check my answer against available past answers  
        This forces active learning, and is far more efficient than reading.
        * I would then study the curriculum areas that question covered, and make notes  
        This would take ~1-2 hours for a new curriculum area.
    * Once I started doing questions which I knew about (having answered one similar previously), I moved up to three questions in 30 minutes  
    This begins to teach you to keep time.
        * I would still check each answer afterwards, look over that area of the curriculum, and revise and refine my notes.
    * When this became easier, I cut myself down to 24 minutes (8 minutes per question)
    * In the weeks before the written, I moved up to 6 or 12 (a full CICM SAQ paper) questions at a time (still at 8 minutes per question)

* Did a *lot* of flashcards  
I did my flashcard deck (almost) every day, including work days. This would take about an hour.
    * This is the absolute best way of learning facts, in my opinion
    * I used [anki](ankisrs.net)

* Did practice vivas
    * These began about a month before the written
    This is absolutely worthwhile doing - there is a lot of crossover of skills between the viva and the written. Both require a structured approach, and good content knowledge.
    * They resumed about 2 weeks after the written  
    Take a break after the written exams, they are exhausting.
