#How to Pass

The first part exam is:
* Painful
* Eminently achievable  
Remember, it is not impossible - **everybody before you has completed it**.

##Plan for Success
This is not an exam you want to have to sit more than once - try to give yourself the best chance of success the first time round.

Commit yourself early:
* Decide when you are going to sit
    * Pick a date ~9 months in advance
        * 6 months is pushing it
        * 9 months is achievable
        * 12 months is almost too long - you will lose motivation and knowledge.
    * Accept that the time between now and the exam is not going to be the best time of your life
    * Consider paying the money as soon as possible - lock yourself in
    * Your family and friends will forgive you, eventually

Don't lose faith:
* There will be times that you question why you have to learn this
    * Accept that much of this exam is an academic hazing ritual (rather than learning clinically applicable knowledge) you must pass through on your path to fellowship

##Be Strategic
The curriculum provided is overwhelming, and probably not achievable for most of us. Have a plan about how you will approach it:
* Have a timetable
    * Content to cover each week  
    I found that setting myself a weekly goal would allow me to plan around day-to-day variations (finishing late, good days, bad days, etc), whilst the daily timetable was often mangled by life, creating unnecessary stress.
    * Time to start viva practice  
    Before the written.

* Know the enemy
    * Syllabus  
    Read through it so you appreciate the breadth of knowledge required.
    * Style of exam questions  
    Including the style of answers - see [the SAQ](.
