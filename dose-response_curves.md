#Dose-Response Curves
>To define and explain dose-effect relationships of drugs, including dose-response curves with reference to: graded and quantal response.

A dose-response curve is a graph of concentration (typically on a logarithmic scale) against the fraction of receptors occupied by a drug. They are a way of graphically comparing the potency and activity of different drugs.

This is a graph of concentration (on a log scale) versus bound drug fraction. It demonstrates that the blue drug has greater **potency** than the green drug, though both are full agonists.

Responses can be either **graded** or **quantal**.
* **Graded responses** demonstrate a **continuous increase** in effect with dose
* **Quantal responses** demonstrate a response once a certain proportion of receptors are occupied (e.g. death).
