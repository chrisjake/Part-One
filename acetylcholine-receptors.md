*This covers the pharmacology of acetylcholine receptors and the production and metabolism of ACh. Detailed information on specific agents is in the pharmacopeia.*

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter vital for normal function of:
* CNS
* ANS
* Muscule contraction

##Synthesis, Release, and Metabolism
ACh is produced is the nerve cytoplasm by **acetyltransferase** from:
* Choline  
From diet and recycled ACh.
* Acetyl-coenzyme A  
Produced in the inner mitochondrial matrix.

Once synthesised, ACh is then packaged into vesicles (each containing ~10,000 ACh molecules), which are **released in response to calcium** influx occurring at the culmination of an action potential.

Acetylcholine is metabolised by acetylcholinesterase on the post-junctional membrane. AChE:
* Has two binding sites:
    * Anionic binding site  
    Binds the positively charged quaternary ammonium moiety.
    * Esteratic binding site    
    Binds the ester group of ACh.
* Once bound, ACh is acetylated
* Acetylated-ACh is then hydrolysed to produce **acetic acid**


##ACh Receptor Subtypes
There are two types of ACh receptor:
* **Nicotinic ACh receptors**
    * Ionotropic  
    Linked to an ion channel.
        * Non-specific - may allow Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cross
    * Consists of five subunits:
        * Two α  
        Bind ACh.
        * One β
        * One δ
        * One γ
    * Located in:
        * Post-synaptic NMJ
        * Preganglionic autonomic nervous system  
        Antagonism causes **ganglion blockade**.
        * Brain
    * Known as nicotinic because nicotine agonises this receptor
    * Activation:
        * 2 ACh molecules must bind to activate the receptor
        * Once bound, receptor undergoes a conformational change which opens the central ion pore  
        Permeability to Na<sup>+</sup> (and to a lesser extent, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) increases, leading to depolarisation


* **Muscarinic ACh receptors**  
    * Metabotropic  
    G-protein coupled.
    * Known as muscarinic because muscarine also agonises this receptor
    * Subdivided into:
        * M<sub>1</sub> (Gq)  
        Secretory glands and CNS.
        * M<sub>2</sub> (Gi)  
        Heart.
        * M<sub>3</sub> Gq  
        Bronchial and arteriolar smooth muscle.
        * M<sub>4</sub> (Gi) and M<sub>5</sub> (Gq)  
        CNS.
