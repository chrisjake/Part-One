# Oxygen {#id}

|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Naturally occuring gas|
|**Uses**|Improve FiO<sub>2</sub>, CO poisoning, hyperbaric O<sub>2</sub> therapy|
|**Pharmaceutics**|Clear, colourless, odourless gas at STP. Critical temperature **-119°C**, manufactured by fractional distillation. Highly flammable.|
|**Route of Administration**|Inhaled|
|**Dosing**|0.21-1.0 FiO<sub>2</sub>|
|**Absorption**|Diffusion across the alveolar capillary membrane in proportion to its pressure gradient, and inversely proportional to the area and thickness of the membrane|
|**Distribution**|Bound to plasma Hb, and dissolved in plasma|
|**Metabolism**|Metabolised in mitochondria of cells during the citric acid cycle to produce ATP, creating CO<sub>2</sub>|
|**Elimination**|Exhalation as CO<sub>2</sub>, or combined with H<sub>2</sub>O to produce HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and eliminated in urine|
|**Resp**|↓ Respiratory drive in all individuals. May result in a fatal ↓ in those dependent on hypoxic drive. **Pulmonary toxicity** due to free radial formation when PiO<sub>2</sub>>0.6bar - pneumonitis/ARDS due to lipid peroxidation of the alveolar-capillary membrane. Absorption atelectasis.|
|**CVS**|Improvement in all CVS parameters in the setting of hypoxia. However, hyperoxia ↓ CO, ↓PVR, ↓PAP, and causes coronary vasoconstriction with prolonged administration|
|**CNS**|CNS O<sub>2</sub> toxicity, typically at pressures >1.6 bar though this is variable. Presents with a variety of neurological symptoms, progressing to disorientation and seizure. Retrolental fibroplasia in neonates exposed to high FiO<sub>2</sub>.|
|**Other**|Fire risk|
