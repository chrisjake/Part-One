# Functional Anatomy and Control of Blood Flow {#id}
>Describe the functional anatomy of the kidneys and renal blood flow.

##Functional Anatomy
The functional unit of the kidney is the **nephron**. Nephrons can be superficial, midcortical, or juxtamedullary, depending on the location of the glomerulus. **Superficial cortical** nephrons have **short loops** of Henle. **Juxtamedullary** nephrons have **long loops**, and the efferent arteriole forms the vasa recta for the kidney. Mid-cortical nephrons may have either long or short loops.

Nephrons are composed of the glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct.

##Control of Renal Blood flow
The kidneys receive **22% of cardiac output** at rest, though **extract** only **10% of delivered O<sub>2</sub>**. The **high renal blood flow** exceeds that required for metabolism, and is instead needed **to produce** the large volume of **glomerular filtrate** (125ml/min) required for excretion of waste. Afferent and efferent arterioles are the main resistance vessels which determine blood flow.


###Autoregulation
Renal blood flow is **autoregulated** over a wide range of mean arterial pressures (60-160mmHg) via **myogenic** and **tubuloglomerular** feedback.

GRAPH OF AUTOREGULATION

**Myogenic** autoregulation is the intrinsic constriction of the afferent arteriole in response to an increased transmural pressure. This increases vascular resistance in proportion to the increase in pressure, keeping flow constant.

**Tubuloglomerular feedback** is more complicated, refers to the constriction or dilation of the afferent arteriole in response to adenosine or NO (respectively) release from the macula densa. The macula densa lies in the wall of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and detects change in tubular flow rate (probably via changing Na<sup>+</sup> flux across its membrane). Increase flow in the loop indicates an increased perfusion pressure, prompting release of adenosine and constriction of the afferent arteriole. Conversely, decreased flow indicates decreased perfusion pressure, reducing adenosine release and prompting the release of NO, which causes the afferent arteriole to dilate.

Notably, flow to juxtamedullary nephrons is not autoregulated. High blood pressure results in increased juxtamedullary flow, increasing GFR and impairing renal concentration, resulting in a **pressure diuresis**.

###Neuronal Control
The kidneys are innervated by noradrenergic sympathetic nerves, which cause afferent and efferent arteriolar constriction. This increases capillary hydrostatic pressure (increasing filtration) and also increases capillary oncotic pressure (decreasing filtration), resulting in an overall slight reduction in GFR.

###Hormonal Control
**Renin** is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus by Î²<sub>1</sub> stimulation, which catalyses the production of angiotensin I from circulating angiotensinogen. Angiotensin I is then converted into Angiotensin II by circulating ACE.
