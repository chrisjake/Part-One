# Oxytocics {#id}

Oxytocics are agents which increase the force of uterine contraction.

|Property|Oxytocin|Ergometrine|PGF<sub>2α</sub>
|--|--|
|**Class**|Endogenous (typically synthetic version used) posterior pituitary hormone|Ergot alkaloid|Prostaglandin
|**Uses**|Augmentation of labour, increase uterine tone (PPH)|PPH|PPH
|**Presentation**|Clear liquid at 5-10 U.ml<sup>-1</sup>|||
|**Route of Administration**|IV||Intramyometrial injection
|**Dosing**|1.5-12mU.min<sup>-1</sup>|||
|**Metabolism**|Oxytocinases in liver and kidney|||
|**Mechanism of Action**|Oxytocin GPCR in the uterus, increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Structurally similar to ADH.|Acts on α and 5HT<sub>2</sub> receptors on uterine and vascular smooth muscle||
|**Resp**|||Bronchospasm
|**CVS**|↑ HR, ↓ BP following boluses |↑ SVR, ↑ BP (may cause, ↓ HR) coronary vasoconstriction| ↑ BP
|**CNS**|Headache, nausea, comiting|Headache, nausea|Nausea, vomiting
|**Renal**|↓ UO due to ADH-like effects with prolonged infusions|||
|**GU**|↑ Uterine tone (↑ frequency at low dose, tetanic contraction at high dose), foetal distress, lactation|↑ Uterine contraction frequency and tone||
|**Other**|May be metabolised by oxytocinases in blood products if coadministered on the same line|Contraindicated in pre-eclampsia due to HTN||
