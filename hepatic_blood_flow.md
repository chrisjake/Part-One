# Hepatic Blood Flow
> Describe the distribution of blood volume and flow in the various regional circulations and explain the factors that influence them, including autoregulation. These include, but not limited to, ~~the cerebral and spinal cord,~~ hepatic and splachnic, ~~coronary, renal and utero-placental~~ circulations

The liver serves as a blood resevoir (30ml per 100g, half of which may be mobilised in hypovolaemia), and receives **25%** of cardiac output from a unique dual blood supply:
* Hepatic arterial system, which supplies about **one-third** of blood, but 40-50% of O<sub>2</sub>  
  Hepatic arterial blood has an **SpO<sub>2</sub>** of **~98%**, as would be expected. It is a high-pressure, high-resistance, high-flow system (average velocity 18cm.s<sup>-1</sup>), with the capacity to autoregulate.


* Portal venous system, which supplies the remaining **two-thirds** of blood.  
It is a low-resistance, low-pressure, low-velocity system (average flow 9cm.s<sup>-1</sup>), with no capacity to autoregulate.  
  The **SpO<sub>2</sub>** of **portal venous blood varies** depending on gut activity:
    * In the **resting gut**, SpO<sub>2</sub> is **~85%**
    * In the **active gut**, SpO<sub>2</sub> is **~75%**

##Regulation of Flow
As with other organs, blood flow is autoregulated via intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, and may be affected by external factors.

###Intrinsic Autoregulation
* Myogenic autoregulation
* Hepatic arterial buffer response  
  This is also known as the "hepatic artery-portal venous semi-reciprocal interrelationship".
    * Hepatic arterial resistance is proportional to portal venous blood flow, such that a reduction in portal venous flow causes a decrease in hepatic arterial resistance and increases hepatic arterial flow  
    This is probably mediated by adenosine.

###Extrinsic Autoregulation
* Autonomic Nervous System  
  Both the hepatic and portal vasculature have sympathetic innervation:
    * The hepatic artery has D-, β-, and α-adrenoreceptors
    * The portal vein has only α-adrenoreceptors  
    Activation of these receptors causes venoconstriction, reducing the compliance of the hepatic vasculature and mobilising up to **250ml** of blood in times of sympathetic stress.
    

* Endocrine and hormonal effects
A number of substances affect portal flow:  
|Hormone|Portal Vein Effect|Hepatic Artery Effect|Overall Effect on Flow|
|--|--|
|**Adrenaline**|Constriction|Constriction (α), then dilation (β)|Reduced|
|**Glucagon**|Dilation|-|Increased|
|**Secretin**|-|Dilation|Increased|
|**Angiotensin II**|Constriction|Constriction|Reduced|
|**Vasopressin**|Constriction|Constriction|Reduced|
|**PCO<sub>2</sub>**|Constriction|-|Reduced|


###External Factors
Flow in the hepatic vein is dependent on venous return:
* Increased venous return (e.g. negative-intrathoracic pressure) increases hepatic flow
* Decreased  venous return (e.g. positive-pressure ventilation, tamponade, haemorrhage), reduces hepatic flow, and in extreme cases flow may only occur intermittently thoughout the cardiac cycle

* **Exercise** reduces both portal vein and hepatic arterial flow

##Microvasculature
Hepatic arterioles and portal venules form the **hepatic triad** with a bile canaliculi. Hepatic arterioles and venules anastomose to form **sinusoids**, which create a specialised low-pressure (~2mmHg) capillary system which drains into the central veins of the hepatic acinus.

This arrangement:
* **Optimises hepatic O<sub>2</sub> extraction**    
  Increased hepatic O<sub>2</sub> demand is met by increasing O<sub>2</sub> extraction, rather than by increasing flow (as occurs in the heart).
* **Prevents shunting and retrograde flow**
