#Elimination
> Describe the mechanisms of drug clearance and metabolism.

Drugs can be eliminated in:
* **Urine**
* **Bile**
* Sweat
* Breast milk
* Tears
* Exhaled gas

##Renal Elimination
Drugs can either be:
* Filtered at the glomerulus  
  Filtered drugs are:
  * **Non-protein bound**  
  Only free drug present in filtered plasma will be excreted - the concentration of the drug will be the same in the *unfiltered* plasma. **Highly protein bound** drugs are therefore **poorly filtered**, as there is no concentration gradient encourages them to decouple from plasma proteins.
  * **Small**
  * **Hydrophilic/lipophobic**  
      Lipophilic drugs may be filtered at the glomerus but will be freely reabsorbed during their passage down the tubule, such that only trivial amounts are eliminated in urine.
* Secreted at the glomerulus
    * * **Active** process allows secretion **against concentration gradients**.
    * Separate mechanisms for acidic and alkaline drugs
        * Saturtable process  
        Saturation may occur of a basic transporter whilst still allowing excretion of acidic drugs.
* Tubular reabsorption  
**Passive diffusion** down a concentration gradient.
* Therefore, acidic drugs have increased elimination in an alkaline urine, and vice versa
    * This is the physiological justification for urinary alkalinisation

##Hepatic Elimination
Biliary elimination occurs for drugs unable to be filtered by the glomerulus. These are typically:
* Large >30,000 dalton
* Lipid soluble

###Enterohepatic recirculation
Biliary excreted drugs may be hydrolysed in the small bowel by bacteria and then reabsorbed, pass through the portal circulation and get metabolised again. This may occur many times.
