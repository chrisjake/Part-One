#Elimination
> Describe the mechanisms of drug clearance and metabolism.

Drugs can be eliminated in:
* **Urine**
* **Bile**
* Sweat
* Breast milk
* Tears
* Exhaled gas

##Renal Elimination
Drugs can be:
* Filtered at the glomerulus  
  Filtered drugs are:
  * **Not protein bound**  
  Only free drug present in filtered plasma will be excreted.
      * Concentration of filtered drug will be the same as in *unfiltered* plasma
      * **Highly protein bound** drugs are **poorly filtered**  
      There is only a weak concentration gradient favouring dissociation from plasma proteins.
  * **Small**  
      * Substances less than 7,000 Da are freely filtered
      * Substances greater than 70,000 Da are essentially impermeable
  * **Hydrophilic/lipophobic**  
      Lipophilic drugs may be filtered at the glomerulus but will be freely reabsorbed during their passage down the tubule, such that only trivial amounts are eliminated in urine.
* Secreted in the tubules
    * **Active** process allows secretion **against concentration gradients**
    * Separate mechanisms for acidic and alkaline drugs
        * Saturatable process  
        Saturation may occur of a basic transporter whilst still allowing excretion of acidic drugs, and vice versa.
* Reabsorbed in the tubules  
**Passive diffusion** down a concentration gradient.
    * Hydrophilic molecules can only be reabsorbed by a specialised transport mechanism  
        * Acidic drugs will be become ionised in an alkaline urine (and vice versa), reducing their solubility    
    This is the physiological justification for urinary alkalinisation.

##Hepatic Elimination
Biliary elimination occurs for drugs unable to be filtered by the glomerulus. These are typically:
* Large  
Greater than 30,000 dalton.
* Lipid soluble

###Enterohepatic recirculation
Drugs excreted in bile may:
* Be hydrolysed in the small bowel by bacteria and then reabsorbed
* Then pass through the portal circulation and get metabolised again
* This process may occur many times
