# Requirements and Starvation
> Describe the normal nutritional requirements

##Starvation
Starvation is the failure to absorb sufficient calories to sustain normal body function, requiring the body to survive on endogenous stores.

* **First 24-48 hours**:
    * Plasma glucose falls
       * Insulin level falls
       * Glucagon level rises
    * Lipolysis  
Stimulated by high glucagon and low insulin levels. Î²-oxidation provides ATP requirements, causing ketone body formation.


* **Days**:
    * Increased gluconeogenesis, using glycerol, lactate, and amino acids
    * Insulin concentraions fall further
    * Energy is conserved trough reduction in movement


* **Weeks**:
    * Tissues adapt to metabolise ketones (with plasma levels rising up to 7 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>, and gluconeogenesis falls
        * The brain still requires 100g of glucose per day
    * BMR falls
    * All but life-saving movement ceases
    * Death typically occurs after 30-60 days, when muscle catabolisation weaknens the respiratory muscles such that secretions can no longer be cleared, and pneumonia occurs.

###Refeeding Syndrome
Refeeding syndrome is a deranged metabolic state that occurs with feeding after a period of prolonged fasting, typically >5 days.

There are three pathogenic mechanisms:
* A large spike in insulin causes increased cellular uptake (and low plasma levels) of:
    * Glucose
    * Magnesium
    * Phosphate
    * Potassium
* Sodium and water retention occurs, which may precipitate cardiac failure
* Increased carbon dioxide production increases minute ventilation and work of exhausted respiratory muscles

Management is by slow institution of feeding and aggressive electrolyte management.
