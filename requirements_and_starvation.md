# Requirements and Starvation
> Describe the normal nutritional requirements

##Fasting
Fasting is the metabolic state achieved after complete digestion and absorption of a meal.

Fasting can be divided into:
* **Early fasting**  
Less than 24 hours.
    * Plasma glucose falls due to consumption
    Leads to hormonal changes:
        * Insulin release decreases, causing:
            * Liver  
                * Decreased glycogenesis
                * Increased gluconeogenesis
            * Muscle  
                * Decreased glucose utilisation
                * Decreased glycogenesis
                * Decreased protein synthesis
            * Fat
                * Decreased lipogenesis  
                Due to:
                    * Decreased glucose uptake
                    * Decreased TG uptake
                * Increased lipolysis
        * Adrenaline release increases, causing:
            * Decreased insulin release
            * Increased lipolysis
            * Increased muscle FFA use
            * Increased hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
        * Glucagon release increases
    * Cellular metabolism alters:
        * Decreased glucose uptake by non-obligate glucose utilisers  
        e.g. muscle.
        * Increased FFA and ketone body use  
        Î²-oxidation of FFAs provides ATP requirements, causing ketone body formation.


* **Sustained fasting**  
Greater than 24 hours. See starvation below.

##Starvation
Starvation is the failure to absorb sufficient calories to sustain normal body function, requiring the body to survive on endogenous stores.

* **Days**:
    * Energy is conserved through reduction in movement
    * Hormonal changes
        * Increased gluconeogenesis, using glycerol, lactate, and amino acids
        * Insulin concentrations fall further
        * Cortisol levels increase
        * Glucagon levels peak at 4 days
    * Metabolic changes
        * Glucose use continues to fall, and FFA use increases
        * Further fall in muscle protein synthesis


* **Weeks**:
    * Tissues adapt to metabolise ketones (with plasma levels rising up to 7 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>, and gluconeogenesis falls
        * The brain still requires 100g of glucose per day
    * BMR falls
    * All but life-saving movement ceases
    * Death typically occurs after 30-60 days, when muscle catabolisation weaknens the respiratory muscles such that secretions can no longer be cleared, and pneumonia occurs.

###Refeeding Syndrome
Refeeding syndrome is a deranged metabolic state that occurs with feeding after a period of prolonged fasting, typically >5 days.

There are three pathogenic mechanisms:
* A large spike in insulin causes increased cellular uptake (and low plasma levels) of:
    * Glucose
    * Magnesium
    * Phosphate
    * Potassium
* Sodium and water retention occurs, which may precipitate cardiac failure
* Increased carbon dioxide production increases minute ventilation and work of exhausted respiratory muscles

Management is by slow institution of feeding and aggressive electrolyte management.
