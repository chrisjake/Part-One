#Internal Jugular Vein
> Describe the anatomy relevant to central venous access (including ~~femoral,~~ internal jugular, ~~external jugular, subclavian and peripheral~~ veins)

The internal jugular vein begins at the **jugular bulb**, a dilatation formed by the confluence of the inferior petrosal sinus and the sigmoid sinus.

The internal jugular vein exits the skull via the **jugular foramen**, and descends laterally to the internal carotid (and later the common carotid) in the **carotid sheath**.

It **joins** with the **subclavian vein** to form the **brachiocephalic vein**.

##Borders
* Anteriorly by SCM
* Posteriorly by the lateral mass of C1, scalene muscles, and lung pleura
* Medially by the internal carotid

##Surface Anatomy
Identify the triangle formed by the two heads of SCM and the clavicle. Palpate the artery, and ensure the site of entry is **lateral** to the carotid. Aim:
* Caudally, at a 30 angle to the frontal plane
* Parallel to the sagittal plane
* Towards the ipsilateral nipple
