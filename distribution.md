# Distribution

> Describe factors influencing the distribution of drugs.

Drug distribution is dependent on:
* **Concentration gradient**
* **Tissue mass**
* **Molecular Weight**  
Larger molecules are less able to cross cell membranes, and so a greater portion will remain in the compartment they are delivered to.
* **Lipid Solubility**
* **Ionisation**  
Ionised drugs are polar, and so are less lipid soluble.
  * Ionisation is a function of:
    * pKa  
    The pKa is the pH at which a weak acid or weak base will be 50% ionised.
      * As solvent pH changes, the proportion of ionised vs. unionised drug will differ  
      * How depends on whether the drug is an acid or base:
        * **B**ases are ionised **B**elow their pKa
        * **A**cids are ionised **A**bove their pKa
    * pH  
    In combination with pKa, affects the ionised portion.
  * Unionised drugs:
    * Cross cell membranes more readily than the ionised form
    * Are typically hepatic metabolised
    * Are typically not renally eliminated
  * Ionised drugs:
    * Are poorly lipid soluble and do not cross cell membranes readily
      * This can lead to ion trapping, where drugs move across a membrane and then are trapped their by a change in pH causing a change in ionised fraction
        * Placenta  
          Foetal pH is lower than matenal pH, which can trap basic drugs \(e.g. LA, opioids\) in foetus.
        * This becomes more significant with a greater divergence of pH \(e.g. placental insufficiency\)
        * Renal elimination  
          Urinary alkalinisation is used to accelerate elimination of acidic drugs, as they become ionised and trapped in urine.
    * Are typically renally excreted without undergoing metabolism
* **Protein binding**  
  * Almost all drugs have some degree of binding to plasma proteins:
    * Acid and neutral drugs bind to **albumin**
      * High capacity
      * Two major binding sites
        * Site I \(warfarin\)
        * Site II \(diazepam\)
    * Alkaline drugs bind to α1-acid glycoprotein
      * Low capacity  
      Typically results in lower total binding (compared to albumin) of alkaline drugs, despite its increased affinity.
  * However, only unbound drugs are able to:
    * Cross cell membranes
    * Interact with receptors
    * Undergo metabolism  
    Reduced protein binding increases clearance of drugs with low **extraction ratios**.
    * Be filtered by the kidney
  * Protein binding is affected by:
    * Affinity of drug for protein
      * Ionised drugs do not bind to protein
      * Competition between drugs for binding sites
    * Amount of protein
      * Disease    
        Due to:
        * Hypoalbuminaemia  
          Negative acute phase reactant.
        * Increased α1-acid glycoprotein    
          Acute phase reactant.
* **Regional blood flow**  
Affects concentration gradients between blood and tissue. Regions include:
  * Vessel Rich Group
    * Brain
    * Heart
    * Liver
    * Kidneys
  * Vessel Poor Group
    * Connective tissue
      * Bones
      * Ligament
      * Teeth
      * Hair
  * Muscle groups
  * Fat
