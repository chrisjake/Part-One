# Distribution

> Describe factors influencing the distribution of drugs.

Drug distribution is dependent on regional **blood flow** and ability of the drug to **cross cell membranes**, which is influenced by molecular size, lipid solubility and ionisation, and protein binding.

Drugs which are able to leave plasma distribute into highly vascular tissues rapidly, and poorly vascular tissues slowly.

## Molecular size

Molecules that are too large to cross cell membranes will remain in the compartment they are delivered to.

* e.g. Macrogol remains in the GIT and is unabsorbed, which results in the osmotic laxative efect

## Lipid solubility and ionisation

* Ionisation is determined by the  **pKa**, or acid dissociation constant, of a drug

  * The pKa is the pH at which a weak acid or weak base will be 50% ionised
  * At a pH different from pKa, the proportion of ionised vs. unionised drug will differ  
    How depends on whether the drug is an acid or base:

  * **B**ases are ionised **B**elow their pKa

  * **A**cids are ionised **A**bove their pKa

* Drugs with a **higher pKa** will **cross membranes less readily**, resulting in a **slower onset time**

* The pKa is given by the **Henderson-Hasselbach equation** : $$ pH = pKa + \log _{10}({[ionised] \over [unionised]}) $$

Unionised drugs:

* Cross cell membranes more readily than the ionised form
* Are typically hepatic metabolised
* Are typically not renally eliminated

Ionised drugs:

* Are poorly lipid soluble and do not cross cell membranes readily

  * This can lead to ion trapping, where drugs move across a membrane and then are trapped their by a change in pH causing a change in ionised fraction

    * Placenta  
      Foetal pH is lower than matenal pH, which can trap basic drugs \(e.g. LA, opioids\) in foetus.

    * This becomes more significant with a greater divergence of pH \(e.g. placental insufficiency\)

    * Renal elimination  
      Urinary alkalinisation is used to accelerate elimination of acidic drugs, as they become ionised and trapped in urine.

* Are typically renally excreted without undergoing metabolism

## Protein binding

Almost all drugs are bound to plasma proteins:

* Acid and neutral drugs bind to **albumin**
  * High capacity
  * Two major binding sites
    * Site I \(warfarin\)
    * Site II \(diazepam\)
* Alkaline drugs bind to α1-acid glycoprotein
  * Low capacity

However, only unbound drugs are able to:

* Cross cell membranes
* Interact with receptors
* Undergo metabolism  
  Reduced protein binding increases clearance of drugs with low **extraction ratios**.

* Be filtered by the kidney

Protein binding is affected by:

* Affinity of drug for protein
  * Ionised drugs do not bind to protein
  * Competition between drugs for binding sites
* Amount of protein
  * Disease  
    Due to:

    * Hypoalbuminaemia  
      Negative acute phase reactant.

    * Increased α1-acid glycoprotein    
      Acute phase reactant.
