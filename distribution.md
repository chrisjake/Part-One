#Distribution
>Describe factors influencing the distribution of drugs.

Drug distribution is dependent on regional **blood flow** and ability of the drug to **cross cell membranes**, which is influenced by molecular size, lipid solubility and ionisation, and protein binding.

Drugs which are able to leave plasma distribute into highly vascular tissues rapidly, and poorly vascular tissues slowly.

##Molecular size
Molecules that are too large to cross cell membranes will remain in the compartment they are delivered to.

>Macrogol remains in the GIT and is unabsorbed, which results in the osmotic laxative efect

##Lipid solubility and ionisation
* Ionisation is determined by the  **pKa**, or acid dissociation constant, of a drug
    * The pKa is the pH at which a weak acid or weak base will be 50% ionised
* At a pH different from pKa, the proportion of ionised vs. unionised drug will differ
    * If the pH is **lower** than the pka, a greater proportion will be **ionised**
    * If the pH is **higher** than the pKa, a greater proportion will be **unionised**
* Unionised drugs cross cell membranes more readily than the ionised form
* Drugs with a **higher pKa** will **cross membranes less readily**, resulting in a **slower onset time**
* The pKa is given by the **Henderson-Hasselbach equation** : $$ pH = pKa + \log _{10}({[ionised] \over [unionised]}) $$

>Rocuronium is polar and consequently poorly lipid soluble, and so must leave plasma via capillary fenestrations. It is unable to cross cell-membranes, and antagonises ACh at the NMJ extracellularly.

##Protein binding
Almost all drugs are bound to plasma proteins:
* Acid drugs bind to albumin
* Alkaline drugs bind to Î±1-acid glycoprotein

However, only unbound drugs are able to cross cell membranes. Protein binding is often reduced in disease states, as a consequence of hypoalbuminaemia.
* Reduced protein binding increases clearance of drugs with low **extraction ratios**
* Reduced protein binding also increases free drug concentration and drug activity
