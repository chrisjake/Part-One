# Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors / Methylxanthines

Methylxanthines non-selectively inhibit phosphodiesterase, which results in reduced levels of cAMP hydrolysis and therefore increased intracellular cAMP, and subsequent smooth muscle relaxation. This effect is synergistic with β<sub>2</sub> agonists, which also increase cAMP by increasing production.
