> Describe the physiological factors that alter diffusing capacity

Rate of diffusion of gases is given by **Fick's Law**:  
$$Rate \ of \ Diffusion \propto {Area \times Pressure \ Gradient \times Solubility \over Thickness \times \sqrt{Molecular \ Weight}}$$

These can be divided into lung factors and subsance factors:
* Lung factors:
  * Surface Area
  * Thickness


* Substance factors:
  * Solubility
  * Molecular weight


* Pressure gradient is a function of the cardiac output and ventilation

##Diffusion and Perfusion Limitation
Limitation refers to what process limits gas uptake into blood:
* Gases which are **diffusion limited** fail to equilibrate, i.e. the partial pressure of a substance in the alveolus does not equal that in the pulmonary capillary
* Gases which are **perfusion limited** have equal alveolar and pulmonary capillary partial pressures, so the amount of gas *content* transferred is dependent on blood flow

###Oxygen
* Oxygen diffusion takes **~0.25s**
* Pulmonary capillary transit time is **0.75s**
* Therefore, under normal conditions oxygen is a **perfusion limited** gas
* However, oxygen may become diffusion limited when:
  * **Alveolar-capillary barrier** disease, which decreases the rate of diffusion
    * Decreased surface area
    * Increased thickness
  * **High cardiac output**, which decreases pulmonary transit time
  * **Altitude**, which decreases PAO<sub>2</sub>

###Carbon Dioxide
* Carbon dioxide is 20x more soluble than oxygen
* Therefore impairment of diffusion capacity causes type 1 respiratory failure as oxygen is affected to a much greater extent than carbon dioxide

###Other Gases
* Due to its high affinity for haemoglobin **carbon monoxide** partial pressures in blood remain low during diffusion (as it has uptake onto haemoglobin)
* **Carbon monoxide** is therefore **diffusion limited**  
This is why it is used to test for diffusion capacity

* **Nitrous oxide** is not bound to haemoglobin and is relatively insoluble, so equilibrium is reached quickly and it is therefore **perfusion limited**

##Diffusion Capacity
* Measurement of the ability of the lung to transfer gases
* Measured as DLCO or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide
* Process:
  * Vital capacity breath of 0.3% CO
  * Held for 10s and exhaled
  * Inspired and expired CO are measured  
  * Difference is the amount of CO which is now bound to Hb
  * DLCO is corrected for:
    * Age
    * Sex
    * Hb
* DLCO is decreased in:
  * Thickened alveolar-capillary barrier
    * Interstitial lung disease
  * Reduced surface area
    * Emphysema
    * PE
    * Lobectomy/pneumonectomy
 * DLCO is increased in:
   * Exercise  
   Recruitment and capillary distension.
   * Alveolar haemorrhage  
   Hb present within the lung binds CO.
   * Asthma (may be normal)  
   Potentially due to increased apical blood flow.
   * Obesity (may be normal)   
   Potentially due to increased cardiac output.
