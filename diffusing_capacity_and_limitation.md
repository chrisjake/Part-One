> Describe the physiological factors that alter diffusing capacity

Rate of diffusion of gases is given by **Fick's Law**:  
$$Rate \ of \ Diffusion = {\Delta P \times A \times s \over T \times \sqrt{MW}}$$, where:
  * $$\Delta P$$ is the pressure gradient across the membrane
  * $$A$$ is the area of the membrane
  * $$s$$ is the solubility of the substance
  * $$T$$ is the thickness of the membrane
  * $$MW$$ is the molecular weight of the substance

These can be divided into pressure, lung factors, and substance factors:
* Pressure gradient  
In the lung, this is a function of:
  * Partial pressure of the gas in the alveolus  
  This is affected by:
    * Atmospheric pressure
    * Ventilation  
    Alveolar hypoventilation will:
      * Increase PA<sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
      * Decrease PA<sub>O<sub>2</sub>
  * Partial pressure of the gas in blood  
  This is affected by:
    * Solubility of the gas in blood  
    CO<sub>2</sub> is **~20** times as soluble as O<sub>2</sub> in blood.
    * Binding of gas to protein:
      * Particularly **haemoglobin**  
      Affects the rate of uptake of O<sub>2</sub> and CO, and is why calculated DL<sub>CO</sub> is corrected for haemoglobin.
        * The shape of the oxy-haemoglobin dissociation curve allows a large volume of oxygen to be bound before PaO<sub>2</sub> begins to rise substantially.  
      * Formation of carbamino compounds
      * Anaesthetic agents to plasma contents  
      e.g. albumin, cholesterol.


* Lung factors:
  * Surface Area  
  Affected by:
    * Parenchyma volume  
      * Body seize
      * Pathology  
      Many lung diseases will reduce surface area for gas exchange.
    * V/Q mismatch  
    Both shunt and dead space reduce the surface area available for gas exchange.
    * Pulmonary blood volume  
    Vascular distension and recruitment also affects surface area. Factors affecting pulmonary blood volume include:
      * Cardiac output  
        * Increased recruitment of vasculature in high output states
        * Decreased recruitment and increased V/Q mismatch in shock states.
      * Posture  
      Increased surface area when supine relative to sitting or standing.
  * Thickness  
  Increasing alveolar-capillary membrane thickness impedes gas exchange. Causes of this include:
    * Pathology  
    Pulmonary oedema and cardiac filure.
  

* Substance factors:
  * Solubility  
  More soluble substances will diffuse more quickly.
  * Molecular weight  
  Smaller substances can diffuse more quickly.

##Diffusion and Perfusion Limitation
Limitation refers to what process limits gas uptake into blood:
* Gases which are **diffusion limited** fail to equilibrate, i.e. the partial pressure of a substance in the alveolus does not equal that in the pulmonary capillary
* Gases which are **perfusion limited** have equal alveolar and pulmonary capillary partial pressures, so the amount of gas *content* transferred is dependent on blood flow

###Oxygen
* Oxygen diffusion takes **~0.25s**
* Pulmonary capillary transit time is **0.75s**
* Therefore, under normal conditions oxygen is a **perfusion limited** gas
* However, oxygen may become diffusion limited when:
  * **Alveolar-capillary barrier** disease, which decreases the rate of diffusion
    * Decreased surface area
    * Increased thickness
  * **High cardiac output**, which decreases pulmonary transit time
  * **Altitude**, which decreases PAO<sub>2</sub>

###Carbon Dioxide
* Carbon dioxide is ventilation limited, rather than diffusion or perfusion limited
* This is because it is:
  * 20x more soluble in blood than oxygen
  * Rapidly produced from bicarbonate and carbamino compounds
  * Present in far greater amounts than oxygen  
  1.8L.kg<sup>-1</sup> exist in the body (though 1.6L<sup>-1</sup> of this are in bone and other relatively inaccessible compartments).
* Impairment of diffusion capacity causes type 1 respiratory failure as oxygen is affected to a much greater extent than carbon dioxide

###Other Gases
* Due to its high affinity for haemoglobin **carbon monoxide** partial pressures in blood remain low during diffusion (as it has uptake onto haemoglobin)
* **Carbon monoxide** is therefore **diffusion limited**  
This is why it is used to test for diffusion capacity

* **Nitrous oxide** is not bound to haemoglobin and is relatively insoluble, so equilibrium is reached quickly and it is therefore **perfusion limited**

##Diffusion Capacity
* Measurement of the ability of the lung to transfer gases
* Measured as DL<sub>CO</sub> or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide
* Process:
  * Vital capacity breath of 0.3% CO
  * Held for 10s and exhaled
  * Inspired and expired CO are measured  
  * Difference is the amount of CO which is now bound to Hb
  * DL<sub>CO</sub> is corrected for:
    * Age
    * Sex
    * Hb
* DL<sub>CO</sub> is decreased in:
  * Thickened alveolar-capillary barrier
    * Interstitial lung disease
  * Reduced surface area
    * Emphysema
    * PE
    * Lobectomy/pneumonectomy
 * D<sub>L<sub>CO</sub></sub> is increased in:
   * Exercise  
   Recruitment and capillary distension.
   * Alveolar haemorrhage  
   Hb present within the lung binds CO.
   * Asthma (may be normal)  
   Potentially due to increased apical blood flow.
   * Obesity (may be normal)   
   Potentially due to increased cardiac output.
