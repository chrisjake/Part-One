#Histamine

> Describe the physiology of histamine ~~and serotonin~~

Histamine is an endogenous amine produced by decarboxylation of **histidine**. Histamine is:
* Present in all tissues  
Particularly abundant in those exposed to the outside environment:
    * Lungs
    * Gut
    * Skin (lungs, gut, skin)
* Produced in and released by:
    * Mast cells  
    Released by exocytosis during inflammatory and allergic reactions.
    * Basophils
    * Histaminocytes in the Stomach
    * Histaminergic neurons in the CNS
* Metabolised by:
    * Histaminase
    * Imidazole N-methyltransferase
    
##Histamine Receptors and Effects
Histamine acts on:
* H<sub>1</sub> receptors  
Gq receptor involved broadly in inflammation.
* H<sub>2</sub> receptors
Gs receptor involved in gastric acid secretion.
* H<sub>3</sub> receptors  
Gi presynaptic receptor in the CNS.
* H<sub>4</sub> receptors  
Gi receptor located in bone marrow and other solid haematological organs (spleen, liver, thymus).

|**GIT**|↑ Peristalsis|↑ Gastric acid secretion|||
|**Haeme**||||Alter IL-16 release
