# Acid-Base Balance
> Describe the role of the kidneys in the maintenance of acid/base balance

Acids produced by the body can be **volatile** (CO<sub>2</sub>) or **fixed** (everything else). The volatile acid load is removed by the lungs at the same rate as it is produced, so there is no net gain or loss of CO<sub>2</sub> and therefore no net gain or loss of H<sup>+</sup>.

The kidney is responsible for excreting fixed acids. These include lactate, sulphate, phosphate, and ketones, of which the the body produces and eliminates **50-80mmol** of H<sup>+</sup> per day.

Mechanisms for elimination of acid include:
* Reabsorption of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  
  This is equivalent to the removal of the same amount of H<sup>+</sup>.
    * As there is usually a net production of acid, under normal circumstances **all filtered HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is reabsorbed**
    * Note that removal of an acid load is associated with greater HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> generation and reabsorption, not increased H<sup>+</sup> secretion 
* Bound to filtered buffers
* As ammonium

The rate and extent of these reactions is dependent on ECF pH and ion concentrations, which gives the kidney control over ion concentrations.

Urinary pH can fall as low as ~4.4, before the active transport of H<sup>+</sup> is inhibited.

##Bicarbonate and the Kidney
Buffer systems minimise changes in pH until the kidney can eliminate excess hydrogen. Bicarbonate is the predominant ECF buffer system (see Acid-Base physiology for more on buffers). By adjusting the level of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> the kidney is able to adjust pH, as per the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

$$ \begin{align*}
pH &= pK_a + log{[HCO_3^-] \over [CO_2]} \\
&= 6.1 + log{24 \over 1.2} \\
&= 7.4
\end{align*}$$

Where:
* $$pK_a$$ = 6.1, the pKa of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
* $$[HCO_3^-]$$ = 24, the normal [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] in mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>
* $$[CO_2]$$ = 1.2, the normal [CO<sub>2</sub>] in mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>

Bicarbonate is:
* Freely filtered  
  4320 mmol.day<sup>-1</sup> of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is filtered (24mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> x 180 L.day<sup>-1</sup>)
* Reabsorbed in the PCT (90%), thick ascending limb, DCT, and CT  
  Adjusting rate of absorption allows correction of an acidosis or alkalosis. All **HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reabsorption is equivalent to a loss of H<sup>+</sup>**.

###Reabsorption of Bicarbonate
Reabsorption of bicarbonate involves several steps:
* H<sup>+</sup> is secreted into the lumen in one of three ways:
    * Primary H<sup>+</sup> ATPase in the PCT and DCT
    * H<sup>+</sup>-Na<sup>+</sup> antiporter in the PCT and ascending limb
    * H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in the CT
* Secreted H<sup>+</sup> combines with filtered HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to form CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O
* CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O diffuse into the tubular cell
* CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O are converted back into HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> in the tubular cell
* HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is reabsorbed into the capillary via the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> antiporter, and the H<sup>+</sup> ion is available to be secreted into the tubule (in exchange for K<sup>+</sup>

This complicated process allows HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to be moved from the tubule to the tubular cell and then to the capillary. **There is no net elimination of H<sup>+</sup>** by this method - the purpose of H<sup>+</sup> secretion is to facilitate the reabsorption[^1] of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> into the tubular cell.

##Bound to Filtered Buffers
Secreted H<sup>+</sup> may also combine with a filtered buffer (e.g. PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>). **These H<sup>+</sup> ions are not reabsorbed**. About **36mmol** of H<sup>+</sup> is eliminated with filtered PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> each day, with each PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> binding **two** H<sup>+</sup> ions.

###Ammonia
Glutamine provides a mechanism for elimination of a large number of H<sup>+</sup> ions:
* This is important in:
  * Elimination of excess metabolic acid
  * Renal compensation for acidosis
* This occurs via:
  * Filtered glutamine is absorbed into **proximal tubular cells** and metabolised to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (ammonium) and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
  * HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> diffuses into blood, and the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is secreted into the tubule via the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-Na<sup>+</sup> antiporter and eliminated in urine
