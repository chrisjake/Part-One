| **Mechanism of action** | V<sub>2</sub> receptors (kidney, platelets) are adenylate cyclase mediated. V<sub>1</sub> (vascular smooth muscle) and V<sub>3</sub> receptors (pituitary) are phospholipase C/inositol triphosphate mediated | Inhibits phosphodiesterase breakdown of cAMP, increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Also increases speed of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into cardiac muscle, increasing luisotropy.| Binds to troponin C increasing myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. Also opens K<sup>+</sup> channels causing vasodilation. It may also have some PD III inhibition effect. |
