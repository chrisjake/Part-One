# Aminoglycosides

Bactericidal antimicrobials that prevent protein synthesis by irreversible binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing mRNA transcription.

* As they are large, polar molecules, they must be actively transported into the cell by an oxygen dependent transporter
* Therefore they are **not effective against anaerobes**
* Transport is inhibited by increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, low pH, and low O<sub>2</sub>

|Property|Gentamicin
|--|--|
|**Uses/Spectrum**|Gram negative including pseudomonas, limited gram positive (staph, limited strep), synergistic effects with Î²-lactams and vancomycin
|**Route of Administration**|IV only
|**Dosing**|4-7mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>
|**Distribution**|70% protein bound. Very small V<sub>D</sub> of 0.2L.kg<sup>-1</sup>, which may result in significant pharmacokinetic changes with oedema
|**Metabolism**|Not metabolised
|**Elimination**|Eliminated unchanged, elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> prolonged up to 70 hours in renal impairment
|**CNS**|Ototoxicity due to accumulation in perilymph, and is usually permanent. Increased risk with concomitant frusemide use
|**MSK**| Muscle weakness
|**Renal**|Nephrotoxicity due to accumulation in the renal cortex, typically reversible
|**Toxic Effects**|Narrow therapeutic index, requires monitoring and dose reduction in renal impairment
