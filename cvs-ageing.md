#Cardiovascular Effects of Ageing

> Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with ageing.

CVS effects of ageing can be divided into cardiac, vascular, and autonomic changes:
* Cardiac changes
    * Decreased receptor density and number
    * Decreased maximum heart rate  
    Due to fibrosis of the SA node causing reduced pacemaker cell number and funtion, and reduction in catecholamine receptor density.
        * $$Maximum \ heart \ rate â‰ˆ 220 - Age$$
    * Decreased inotropy  
    Minor.
    * Increased reliance on atrial kick  
    Reduced ventricular compliance increases the reliance on atrial kick to achieve adequate preload.
    * Decreased diastolic compliance
        * Due to hypertrophy from increased afterload
        
        
* Vascular changes
    * Reduced compliance  
    Due to loss of elastic tissue in the large arteries.
    * Increased SVR  
    Reduced compliance results in increased vascular resistance.
    * Reduced endothelial cell function (decreased NO)  
    Impairs the ability of the vascular tree to adapt to changes in pressure/volume leading to:
        * Elevated SBP
        * Reduced DBP  
        Reduced elastic recoil causes diastolic run off and a fall in diastolic blood pressure.
    * Reduced catecholamine receptor density  
    Reduced responsiveness to (and increased number of) circulating catecholamines.
    
    
* Autonomic
    * Impaired autonomic function  
    Due to decreased catecholamine responsiveness.
    * Impaired baroreceptor response
    * Decreased exercise tolerance  
    Reliance on preload to maintain cardiac output.
