#Cardiovascular Effects of Ageing

> Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with ageing.

CVS effects of ageing can be divided into cardiac, vascular, and autonomic changes:
* Cardiac changes
    * Decreased receptor density and number
    * Decreased maximum heart rate
    * Decreased EF
    * Decreased diastolic compliance
* Vascular changes
    * Increased TPR
    * Reduced compliance
    * Blunted baroreceptor responses
    * Reduced catecholamine receptor density
    * Reduced endothelial cell function (decreased NO)
* Autonomic
    * Impaired autonomic function
