# Temperature and Humidity

> Describe the measurement of temperature and humidity

**Temperature** is the tendency of a body to transfer heat energy to another body, and is measured in degrees. It is distinct from **heat**, which is the kinetic energy content of a body, and is measured in Joules. The two are related by the **specific heat capacity**, which describes how much energy (J) must be applied to a body to raise its temperature from 14째C to 15째C, without a change in state.

Humidity may be either **absolute** or **relative**:
* **Absolute Humidity** is the mass of water vapour in a volume of air
* **Relative Humidity** measures the percentage saturation of air at *current temperature*, or more formally: $$Relative \ Humidity = {mass \ of \ water \ vapour \ in \ volume \ of \ air \over mass \ of \ water \ vapour \ if \ air \ was \ fully \ saturated} = {absolute \ humidity \over mass \ of \ water \ if \ air \ was \ fully \ saturated} $$

##Measurement of Temperature
Temperature is measured by a number of methods:

###Liquid Expansion Thermometry
This is used in mercury thermometers. These consist of:
* A graduated **evacuated capillary** of negligible volume, attached to
* A mercury resevoir, of much greater volume, separated by
* A constriction ring  
Prevents travel of mercury up the capillary by gravity.

Mechanism:
* When heated, the kinetic energy of the mercury increases and it expands, forcing it up the capillary  
As the thermal expansion coefficient for all liquids is very small, the capillary must be of a very small volume to create a useable device.
* The speed that this occurs is related to the **time-constant** of the system  
This is typically 30 seconds. Measurement therefore takes ~4 time-constants, or 2 minutes.

####Pros
* Easy to use
* Accurate
* Reusable
* Sterilisable
* Cheap

####Cons
* Slow response  
Only accurate once it has reached thermal equilibrium.
* Glass can break  
May cause release of mercury or alcohol.
* Inaccurate at:
    * Low temperatures with mercury  
    Freezes at -38.8째C.
    * High temperatures with alcohol  
    Boils at 78.5째C. 

##Electrical
Electrical methods include:
* **Resistance thermometer**  
Platinum wire increases electrical resistance with increasing temperatur.
    * Therefore the voltage drop across the wire will correspond to the temperature of the wire
    * Change in resistance is linear across the temperature range
    * However, these are expensive.
* **Thermistor**  
Metal (e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>) semiconductor which changes its resistance in a **predictably non-linear fashion** (run-away exponent) with temperature.
    * Can be manufactured so that change is linear over the clinical range
    * Much cheaper than wire resistance methods
    * The degree of voltage drop is usually very small, however this can be amplified using a **wheatstone bridge**
* **Thermocouple**  
At the junction of two dissimilar metals, a potential difference will be produced proportional to their temperature. This is known as the Seebeck effect.
    * Non-linear (wash in exponent)
    * Degrade over time


##Measurement of Humidity
Humidity can be measured by a number of methods:

* **Hair Hygrometer**  
Hair (actual hair) changes elasticity depending on the humidity of air. Changes in elasticity can be related to changes in humidity.

* **Wet and Dry Bulb**  
This system measures both temperature and relative humidity.
    * Two thermometers are used
        * One is wrapped in a wick, which is attached to a water reservoir  
        This is the wet thermometer.
        * The dry thermometer gives a measurement of surrounding air temperature
    * The wet thermometer is cooled due to evaporative cooling from the wick  
    High energy water molecules become vapour, leaving only low energy molecules behind.
    * The **temperature difference** between the thermometers is a function of:
        * Latent heat of vaporisation of water
        * How much evaporative cooling is occurring  
        This is function of humidity.
            * At 100% relative humidity, no evaporative cooling will take place and the temperatures will be equal
            * As humidity decreases, the temperature difference will become more marked, and humidity can be calculated

##Humidification
Humidification refers to increasing the water content of inspired patient gases. Methods of humidification can be:
* Active
* Passive

###Heat-Moisture Exchange Filter
* Small device placed into breathing circuit distal to patient y-piece
* Constructed with several vanes of a **hygroscopic** material, causing water (and therefore heat) to be trapped on the patient side of the filter

####Pros
* Cheap
* Easy to use
* May contain anti-bacterial filter

####Cons
* Less effective than active methods
* Increases dead space volume
* Takes 15-20 minutes to become fully effective
* May be blocked by secretions
* Lasts 24 hours - inappropriate for long term ventilation

###Active Humidification
* Device which adds a heated sterile water bath to to the inspiratory limb of the circuit
* Inspired gas typically achieves 100% relative humidity

###Pros
* Complete humidification achieved
* Can be used indefinitely

###Cons
* Expensive
* Water bath may lead to bacterial contamination
