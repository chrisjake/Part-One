# Temperature and Humidity

**Temperature** is the tendency of a body to transfer heat energy to another body, and is measured in degrees. It is distinct from **heat**, which is the kinetic energy content of a body, and is measured in Joules. The two are related by the **specific heat capacity**, which describes how much energy (J) must be applied to a body to raise its temperature from 14°C to 15°C, without a change in state.

Humidity may be either **absolute** or **relative**:
* **Absolute Humidity** is the mass of water vapour in a volume of air
* **Relative Humidity** measures the percentage saturation of air at *current temperature*, or more formally: $$Relative \ Humidity = {mass \ of \ water \ vapour \ in \ volume \ of \ air \over mass \ of \ water \ vapour \ if \ air \ was \ fully \ saturated} = {absolute \ humidity \over mass \ of \ water \ if \ air \ was \ fully \ saturated} $$

##Measurement of Temperature
Temperature is measured by a number of methods:

###Liquid Expansion Thermometry
This is used in mercury thermometers. These consist of:
* A graduated **evacuated capillary** of negligible volume, attached to
* A mercury resevoir, of much greater volume, separated by
* A constriction ring, which prevents travel of mercury up the capillary by gravity

When heated, the kinetic energy of the mercury increases and it expands, forcing it up the capillary. The speed that this occurs is related to the **time-constant** of the system, typically 30 seconds. Measurement takes ~4 time-constants, i.e. 2 minutes.

##Electrical
These may be either a standard length of platinum wire, or a thermistor. Platinum wire increases electrical resistance with increasing temperature, and therefore the voltage drop across the wire will correspond to the temperature of the wire. However, these are expensive.

A **thermistor** is a metallic oxide (e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>) electical component which changes its resistance in a **predictably non-linear fashion** with temperature. The degree of voltage drop is usually very small, however this can be amplified using a **wheatstone bridge**.

##Measurement of Humidity
Humidity can be measured by a number of methods. The following are measures of **relative humidity**:

##Hair Hygrometer
Hair (actual hair) changes elasticity depending on the humidity of air. Changes in elasticity can be related to changes in humidity.

##Wet and Dry Bulb
This system measures both temperature and relative humidity.

Two thermometers are used. One is wrapped in a wick, which is attached to a water resevoir. This is the wet thermometer.

The dry thermometer gives a measurement of surrounding air temperature, as would be expected.

The wet thermometer is cooled due to evaporative cooling from the wick, as high energy water molecules become vapour, leaving only low energy molecules behind. The **temperature difference** between the thermometers is therefore a function of the latent heat of vaporisation of water, and how much evaporative cooling is occurring, which in turn is a function of humidity. In 100% relative humidity, no evaporative cooling will take place and the temperatures will be equal. As humidity decreases, the temperature difference will become more marked, and humidity can be calculated.
