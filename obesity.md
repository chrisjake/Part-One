#Obesity

Obesity is a multisystem disorder defined by an elevated body mass index (BMI):
* Normal: BMI < 25
* Overweight: BMI 25 - 30
* Obese: BMI > 30
* Morbidly Obese:  
    * Obesity related disease and a BMI > 35
    * BMI > 40
    
Characteristics of obesity include:
* Complex genetic and environmental causes
* Increased caloric intake
* Increased metabolic rate (normal for BSA)

Obesity is associated with many diseases (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, etc), but primary exam questions focus predominantly on physiological effects of uncomplicated obesity.

##Respiratory Effects
Respiratory effects predominantly due to increased fat load and its distribution:
* Increased neck fat predisposes to airway collapse in negative pressure ventilation (OSA) and increases difficulty of surgical airway and IJ CVC insertion
* Abdominal fat increases intrabdominal fat and reduces FRC, increasing shunt and causing resting hypoxia  
    * FRC typically decreased to ~1L when BMI > 40.
    * FRC may approach closing capacity
    * Shunt may worsen during anaesthesia

##Cardiovascular Effects
Increased fat bed causes increased:
* V̇O<sub>2</sub> and V̇CO<sub>2</sub>
* Cardiac output  
To meet increased V̇O<sub>2</sub> requirements.
* Stroke volume  
Main method of increasing CO.
* Blood volume  
Due to RAAS activation.

Additionally:
* Increased PVR  
Reduction in FRC due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction increases right ventricular afterload.

Compensatory changes result, causing:
* Systemic and pulmonary hypertension
* Ventricular remodeling
    * Ventricular hypertrophy  
    Due to pressure overload.
    * Ventriculr dilation  
    Due to volume overload.
    
These compensatory changes lead to:
* Arrhythmias  
Due to change in myocardial architecture and hypoxia.
* Increased circulating catecholamines

##GIT Effects
Increased risk of:
* GORD
* Hiatus hernia
